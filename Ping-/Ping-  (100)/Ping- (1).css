Preface
First, a basic question: just what are organizations anyway? Why do they
exist? Some experts believe that the reason organizations exist is because of the
high cost of executing transactions in the marketplace. Within an organization
we can reallocate resources without the need to negotiate contracts, formally
transfer ownership of assets, and so on. No need for lawyers, the managers do
things on their own authority. The question is: how should they do this? In the
free market prices tell us how to allocate resources, but prices don’t exist inside
of an organization. We must come up with some alternative.
Transaction costs aside, organizations exist to serve constituencies.
Businesses have shareholders or private owners. The equivalent for non-profits
are contributors. Organizations also serve ‘‘customer’’ constituencies. In other
words, they produce things that other people want. Businesses must produce
things that people are willing and able to buy for their own benefit. Non-profits
must produce things that contributors are willing and able to buy for the benefit
of others. Both types of organizations must do one thing: create value. The output must be of greater value than the inputs needed to produce it. If the output
serves the constituencies well, the organization is effective. If it creates added
value with a minimum of resources, it is efficient. (It is a common misconception that non-profits don’t need to be efficient. But the only difference between
a for-profit and a not-for-profit is that the ‘‘surplus’’ created by adding value is
used for different purposes. A not-for-profit that produces negative value (i.e.,
spends more for its output than contributors are willing to pay) will not survive
any more than a business posting continuous losses.) Boards of directors evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of management and have the authority and
duty to direct and replace inefficient or ineffective managers.

Six Sigma’s role in all of this is to help management produce the maximum
value while using minimum resources. It does this by rationalizing management. By this I mean that it applies scientific principles to processes and products. By using the Six Sigma DMAIC approach processes or products are
improved in the sense that they are more effective, more efficient, or both. If
no process or product exists, or if existing processes or products are deemed
beyond repair, then design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methods are used to create
effective and efficient processes or products. Properly applied, Six Sigma minimizes the negative impact of politics on the organization. Of course, in any
undertaking involving human beings, politics can never be completely eliminated. Even in the best of Six Sigma organizations there will still be the occasional Six Sigma project where data-based findings are ignored because they
conflict with the preconceived notions of a powerful figure in the organization.
But this will be the exception rather than the rule.
It should be obvious by now that I don’t view Six Sigma either as a panacea or
as a mere tool. The companies that have successfully implemented Six Sigma
are well-known, including GE, Allied Signal, Intuit, Boeing Satellite Systems,
American Express and many others. But the picture isn’t entirely rosy, failures
also exist, most notably Motorola, the company that invented Six Sigma.
Running a successful business is an extremely complicated undertaking and it
involves much more than Six Sigma. Any organization that obsesses on Six
Sigma to the exclusion of such things as radical innovation, solid financial management, a keen eye for changing external factors, integrity in accounting, etc.
can expect to find itself in trouble some day. Markets are akin to jungles, and
much danger lurks. Six Sigma can help an organization do some things better,
but there are places where Six Sigma doesn’t apply. I seriously doubt that Six
Sigma would’ve helped Albert Einstein discover relativity or Mozart compose
a better opera. Recognizing the limits of Six Sigma while exploiting its strengths
is the job of senior leadership.
If you are working in a traditional organization, deploying Six Sigma will
rock your world. If you are a traditional manager, you will be knocked so far
out of your comfort zone that you will literally lose sleep trying to figure out
what’s happening. Your most cherished assumptions will be challenged by
your boss, the accepted way of doing things will no longer do. A new full-time,
temporary position will be created which has a single mission: change the orgaxiv Preface

Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.
Whether Six Sigma has anythingto do with Motorola’s recent problems is hotly debated. But it is undeniablethat Motorola
relied heavily on Six sigma and that it has had difficulties in recent years. Still, Motorola is a fine company with a long and
splendid history, and I expect to see it back on top in the not too distant future.
nization. People with the word ‘‘belt’’ in their job title will suddenly appear,
speaking an odd new language of statistics and project management. What
used to be your exclusive turf will be identified as parts of turf-spanning processes; your budget authority may be usurped by new ‘‘Process Owners.’’ The
new change agents will prowl the hallowed halls of your department, continuously stirring things up as they poke here and peek there, uncovering inefficiency and waste in places where you never dreamed improvement was
possible. Your data will be scrutinized and once indispensable reports will be
discontinued, leaving you feeling as if you’ve lost the star you use to naviage.
New reports, mostly graphical, will appear with peculiar lines on them labeled
‘‘control limits’’ and ‘‘process mean.’’ You will need to learn the meaning of
such terms to survive in the new organization; in some organizations you
won’t be eligible for advancement until you are a trained ‘‘belt.’’ In others, you
won’t even be allowed to stay.
When done properly, the result of deploying Six Sigma is an organization
that does a better job of serving owners and customers. Employees who adapt
to the new culture are better paid and happier. The work environment is exciting and dynamic and change becomes a way of life. Decisions are based on reason and rationality, rather than on mysterious back-room politics.
However, when done half-heartedly, Six Sigma (or any other improvement
initiative) is a colossal waste of money and time. The message is clear: do it
right, or don’t do it at all.
It has been nearly two decades since Six Sigma began and the popularity of
the approach continues to grow. As more and more firms adopt Six Sigma as
their organizational philosophy, they also adapt it to their own unique circumstances. Thus, Six Sigma has evolved. This is especially true in the way Six
Sigma is used to operationalize the organization’s strategy. Inspired leaders,
such as Jack Welch and Larry Bossidy, have incorporated Six Sigma into the fabric of their businesses and achieved results beyond the predictions of the most
enthusiastic Six Sigma advocate. Six Sigma has also been expanded from merely
improving existing processes to the design of new products and processes that
start life at quality and performance levels near or above Six Sigma. Six Sigma
has also been integrated with that other big productivity movement, Lean
Manufacturing. In this second edition I attempt to capture these new developments and show how the new Six Sigma works.

Introduction
The goal of this book remains the same as for the first edition, namely, to provide you with the comprehensive guidance and direction necessary to realize
Six Sigma’s promise, while avoiding traps and pitfalls commonly encountered.
Inthis book you will find a complete overview of the management and organization of Six Sigma, the philosophy which underlies Six Sigma, and those problem
solving techniques and statistical tools most often used in Six Sigma. It is not
intended to be an ASQ certification study guide, although it includes coverage
of most of the topics included in the ASQ body of knowledge. Rather it is
intended as a guide for champions, leaders, ‘‘belts,’’ team members and others
interested in using the Six Sigma approach to make their organizations more
efficient, more effective, or both. In short, it is a user’s manual, not a classroom
textbook.
Compared to the first edition, you will find less discussion of theory. I love
theory, but Six Sigma is quite hard-nosed in its bottom-line emphasis and I
know that serious practitioners are more interested in how to use the tools and
techniques to obtain results than in the theory underlying a particular tool.
(Of course, theory is provided to the extent necessary to understand the proper
use and limitations of a given tool.) Minitab and other software are used extensively to illustrate how to apply statistical techniques in a variety of situations
encountered during Six Sigma projects. I believe that one of the major differences between Six Sigma and previous initiatives, such as TQM, is the integration of powerful computer-based tools into the training. Many actual examples
are used, making this book something of a practical guide based on the school
of hard knocks.
Several different constituencies can benefit from this book. To serve these
constituents I separate the book into different parts. Part I is aimed at senior
Copyright 2003 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click Here for Terms of Use.
leaders and those managers who are charged with developing strategies and
deploying the Six Sigma systems within the organization. In Part I you will
find a high level presentation of the philosophy behind Six Sigma, but I get
down to the nuts and bolts very quickly. By this I mean identifying how Six
Sigma will change the organization, and answer such questions as what are the
new positions that will be created? What knowledge, skills, abilities and personal attributes should those filling these positions possess? What personnel
assessment criteria should be used, and how can these criteria be used to evaluate candidates? Do we need to formally test applicants? What are the specific
responsibilities of people in the organization with respect to Six Sigma?
Unless such issues are carefully considered and addressed, Six Sigma will fail.
There’s no real point to training Black Belts, Green Belts, and other parts of
the Six Sigma infrastructure if the supporting superstructure isn’t in place.
Part I also addresses the issue of linking Six Sigmato the enterprise’s strategic
goals and objectives. Six Sigma is not Management By Objectives, but MBO
didn’t fail because it was an entirely bad idea. What was missing from MBO
was an understanding that results are process-driven and the development of a
resource pool and the building of an infrastructure that was dedicated to driving
the change necessary to accomplish the objectives. With Six Sigma one doesn’t
achieve objectives by directly manipulating results, but by changing the way
things are done. The driving force behind this change are the ‘‘belts,’’ who are
highly trained full- and part-time change agents. These people lead and support
projects, and it is the projects that drive change. But not just any projects will
do. Projects must be derived from the needs of the enterprise and its customers.
This is accomplished via a rigorous flow-down process that starts at the top of
the organization. In addition to describing the mechanisms that accomplish
this linkage, Part I describes the importance of rewards and incentives to success. In short, Six Sigma becomes the way senior leaders reach their goals.
Part II presents the tools and techniques of Six Sigma. Six Sigma provides
an improvement framework known as Define-Measure-Analyze-ImproveControl (DMAIC), and I have elected to organize the technical material within
the DMAIC framework. It is important to note that this isn’t always the best
way to first learn these techniques. Indeed, as a consultant I find that the Black
Belt trainee often needs to use tools from the improve or control phase while
she is still working in the define or measure phase of her project. Also,
DMAIC is often used to establish ‘‘tollgates’’ at the end of each phase to help
with project tracking, but there is usually considerable back-and-forth movement between the phases as the project progresses and one often finds that a
‘‘closed gate’’ must be kept at least partially ajar. Still, DMAIC serves the important purpose of providing a context for a given tool and a structure for the
change process.
Introduction xvii
The presentation of DMAIC is followed by design for Six Sigma (DFSS)
principles and practices. The DFSS methodology focuses on the DefineMeasure-Analyze-Design-Verify (DMADV) approach, which builds on the
reader’s understanding of DMAIC. DFSS is used primarily when there is no
process in existence, or whenthe existing process isto be completely redesigned.
Finally, a chapter on Lean Manufacturing provides the reader with an overview of this important topic and discusses its relationship to Six Sigma.
DMAIC overview . The De¢ne phase of the book covers process mapping and £owcharting,
project charter development, problem solving tools, and the so-called 7M
tools. . Measure covers the principles of measurement, continuous and discrete
data, scales of measurement, an overview of the principles of variation,
and repeatability-and-reproducibility (RR) studies for continuous and
discrete data. . Analyzecovers establishing a process base line, how to determine process
improvement goals, knowledge discovery, including descriptive and
exploratory data analysis and data mining tools, the basic principles of statistical process control (SPC), specialized control charts, process capability analysis, correlation and regression analysis, analysis of categorical
data, and non-parametric statistical methods. . Improve covers project management, risk assessment, process simulation, design of experiments (DOE), robust design concepts (including

Infrastructure
WHAT IS SIX SIGMA?
This section provides a 10,000 foot overview of Six Sigma. Subsequent sections elaborate and provide additional information on tools and techniques.
Six Sigma is a rigorous, focused and highly effective implementation of proven quality principles and techniques. Incorporating elements from the work
of many quality pioneers, Six Sigma aims for virtually error free business performance. Sigma, s, is a letter in the Greek alphabet used by statisticians to measure the variability in any process. A company’s performance is measured by
the sigma level of their business processes. Traditionally companies accepted
three or four sigma performance levels as the norm, despite the fact that these
processes created between 6,200 and 67,000 problems per million opportunities!
The Six Sigma standard of 3.4 problems per million opportunities* is a response
to the increasing expectations of customers and the increased complexity of
modern products and processes.
If you’re looking for new techniques, don’t bother. Six Sigma’s magic isn’t in
statistical or high-tech razzle-dazzle. Six Sigma relies on tried and true methods
that have been around for decades. In fact, Six Sigma discards a great deal of
*Statisticians note: the area under the normal curve beyond Six Sigma is 2 parts-per-billion. In calculating failure rates for Six
Sigma purposes we assume that performance experienced by customers over the life of the product or process will be much
worse than internal short-term estimates predict. To compensate, a ‘‘shift’’ of 1.5 sigma from the mean is added before calculating estimated long-term failures. Thus, you will find 3.4 parts-per-million asthe area beyond 4.5 sigma on the normal curve.

the complexity that characterized Total Quality Management (TQM). By one
expert’s count, there were over 400 TQM tools and techniques. Six Sigma
takes a handful of proven methods and trains a small cadre of in-house technical
leaders, known as Six Sigma Black Belts, to a high level of proficiency in the
application of these techniques. To be sure, some of the methods Black Belts
use are highly advanced, including up-to-date computer technology. But the
tools are applied within a simple performance improvement model known as
Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control, or DMAIC. DMAIC is described
briefly as follows:
D De¢ne the goals of the improvement activity.
M Measurethe existing system.
A Analyze the system to identify ways to eliminate the gap
between the current performance of the system or
process and the desired goal.
I Improvethe system.
C Control the new system.
Why Six Sigma?
When a Japanese firm took over a Motorola factory that manufactured
Quasar television sets in the United States in the 1970s, they promptly set
about making drastic changes in the way the factory operated. Under Japanese
management, the factory was soon producing TV sets with 1/20th
as many
defects as they had produced under Motorola’s management. They did this
using the same workforce, technology, and designs, and did it while lowering
costs, making it clear that the problem was Motorola’s management. It took a
while but, eventually, even Motorola’s own executives finally admitted ‘‘Our
quality stinks’’ (Main, 1994).
It took until nearly the mid-1980s before Motorola figured out what to do
about it. Bob Galvin, Motorola’s CEO at the time, started the company on
the quality path known as Six Sigma and became a business icon largely as a
result of what he accomplished in quality at Motorola. Using Six Sigma
Motorola became known as a quality leader and a profit leader. After
Motorola won the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1988 the
secret of their success became public knowledge and the Six Sigma revolution
was on. Today it’s hotter than ever. Even though Motorola has been struggling
4 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
the past few years, companies such as GE and AlliedSignal have taken up the
Six Sigma banner and used it to lead themselves to new levels of customer service and productivity.
It would be a mistake to think that Six Sigma is about quality in the traditional sense. Quality, defined traditionally as conformance to internal requirements, has little to do with Six Sigma. Six Sigma is about helping the
organization make more money by improving customer value and efficiency.
To link this objective of Six Sigma with quality requires a new definition of
quality. For Six Sigma purposes I define quality as the value added by a productive endeavor. Quality comes in two flavors: potential quality and actual
quality. Potential quality is the known maximum possible value added per
unit of input. Actual quality is the current value added per unit of input. The
difference between potential and actual quality is waste. Six Sigma focuses
on improving quality (i.e., reducing waste) by helping organizations produce
products and services better, faster and cheaper. There is a direct correspondence between quality levels and ‘‘sigma levels’’ of performance. For example,
a process operating at Six Sigma will fail to meet requirements about 3 times
per million transactions. The typical company operates at roughly four
sigma, which means they produce roughly 6,210 failures per million transactions. Six Sigma focuses on customer requirements, defect prevention, cycle
time reduction, and cost savings. Thus, the benefits from Six Sigma go straight
to the bottom line. Unlike mindless cost-cutting programs which also reduce
value and quality, Six Sigma identifies and eliminates costs which provide no
value to customers, waste costs.
For non-Six Sigma companies, these costs are often extremely high.
Companies operating at three or four sigma typically spend between 25 and 40
percent of their revenues fixing problems. This is known as the cost of quality,
or more accurately the cost of poor quality. Companies operating at Six Sigma
typically spend less than 5 percent of their revenues fixing problems (Figure
1.1). COPQ values shown in Figure 1.1 are at the lower end of the range of
results reported in various studies. The dollar cost of this gap can be huge.
General Electric estimated that the gap between three or four sigma and Six
Sigma was costing them between $8 billion and $12 billion per year.
One reason why costs are directly related to sigma levels is very simple: sigma
levels are a measure of error rates, and it costs money to correct errors. Figure
1.2 shows the relationship between errors and sigma levels. Note that the error
rate drops exponentially as the sigma level goes up, and that this correlates
well to the empirical cost data shown in Figure 1.1. Also note that the errors
are shown as errors per million opportunities, not as percentages. This is
another convention introduced by Six Sigma. In the past we could tolerate percentage error rates (errors per hundred opportunities), today we cannot.
What Is Six Sigma? 5
The Six Sigma philosophy
Six Sigma is the application of the scientific method to the design and operation of management systems and business processes which enable employees
to deliver the greatest value to customers and owners. The scientific method
works as follows:
1. Observe some important aspect of the marketplace or your business.
2. Develop a tentative explanation, or hypothesis, consistent with your
observations.
3. Based on your hypothesis, make predictions.
4. Test your predictions by conducting experiments or making further
careful observations. Record your observations. Modify your hypothesis
based on the new facts. If variation exists, use statistical tools to help
you separate signal from noise.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 untilthere are no discrepancies betweenthe hypothesis and the results from experiments or observations.
At this point you have a viabletheory explaining an important relationship in
your market or business. The theory is your crystal ball, which you can use to
predict the future. As you can imagine, a crystal ball is a very useful thing to
have around. Furthermore, it often happens that your theory will explain things
other than the thing you initially studied. Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity
may have begun with the observation that apples fell towards the earth, but
Newton’s laws of motion explained a great deal about the way planets moved
about the sun. By applying the scientific method over a period of years you will
develop a deep understanding of what makes your customer and your business
tick.
6 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
Figure 1.1. Cost of poor quality versus sigma level.
In Six Sigma organizations this approach is applied across the board. The
result is that political influence is minimized and a ‘‘show me the data’’ attitude
prevails. Not that corporate politics are eliminated, they can never be where
human beings interact. But politics are much less an influence in Six Sigma organizations than in traditional organizations. People are often quite surprised at
the results of this seemingly simple shift in attitude. The essence of these results
is stated quite succinctly by ‘‘Pyzdek’s Law’’:
Most of what you know is wrong!
Like all such ‘‘laws,’’ this is an overstatement. However, you’ll be stunned by
how often people are unable to provide data supporting their positions on
basic issues when challenged to do so. For example, the manager of a technical
support call center was challenged by the CEO to show that customers cared
deeply about hold time. When he looked into it the manager found that customers cared more about the time it took to reach a technician and whether or
not their issue was resolved. The call center’s information system was measuring hold time not only as the time until the technician first answered the
phone, but also the time the customer was on hold while the technician
researched the answer to the call. The customer cared much less about this
What Is Six Sigma? 7
Figure 1.2. Error rate versus sigma level.
‘‘hold time’’ because it helped with the resolution of the issue. This fundamental
change in focus made a great deal of difference in the way the call center operated.
The Six Sigma philosophy focuses the attention of everyone on the stakeholders
for whom the enterprise exists. It is a cause-and-effect mentality. Well-designed
management systems and business processes operated by happy employees
cause customers and owners to be satisfied or delighted. Of course, none of
this is new. Most leaders of traditional organizations honestly believe that this
is what they already do. What distinguishes the traditional approach from Six
Sigma is the degree of rigor.
JUST DO IT!
Six Sigma organizations are not academic institutions. They compete in the
fast-paced world of business and they don’t have the luxury of taking years to
study all aspects of a problem before deciding on a course of action. A valuable
skill for the leader of a Six Sigma enterprise, or for the sponsor of a Six Sigma
project, isto decide when enough information has been obtainedto warranttaking a particular course of action and moving on. Six Sigma leadership is very
hard-nosed when it comes to spending the shareholder’s dollars and project
research tends to be tightly focused on delivering information useful for management decision-making. Once a level of confidence is achieved, management
must direct the Black Belt to move the project from the Analyze phase to the

What we know
We all know that there was a surge in births nine months after the November
1965 New York City power failure, right? After all, the New YorkT|mes said so
in a story that ran August 8, 1966. If that’s not prestigious enough for you, consider that the source quoted in the T|mes article was the city’s Mt. Sinai
Hospital, one of the best.
What the data show
The newspaper compared the births on August 8, 1965 with those on August
8, 1966. This one-day comparison did indeed show an increase year-over-year.
However, J. Richard Udry, director of the Carolina Population Center at the
University of North Carolina, studied birthrates at several New York City hospitals between July 27 and August 14, 1966. His ¢nding: the birthrate nine
months after the blackout was slightly below the ¢ve-year average.
Improve phase, or from the Improve phase to the Control phase. Projects are
closed and resources moved to new projects as quickly as possible.
Six Sigma organizations are not infallible, they make their share of mistakes
and miss some opportunities they might have found had they taken time to
explore more possibilities. Still, they make fewer mistakes than their traditional
counterparts and scholarly research has shown that they perform significantly
better in the long run.
WHAT’S IMPORTANT?
While working with an aerospace client, I was helping an executive set up a
system for identifying potential Six Sigma projects in his area. I asked ‘‘What
are your most important metrics? What do you focus on?’’ ‘‘That’s easy,’’ he
responded. ‘‘We just completed our monthly ops review so I can show you.’’
He then called his secretary and asked that she bring the ops review copies.
Soon the secretary came in lugging three large, loose-leaf binders filled with
copies of PowerPoint slides. This executive and his staff spend one very long
day each month reviewing all of these metrics, hoping to glean some direction
to help them plan for the future. This is not focusing, it’s torture!
Sadly, this is not an isolated case. Over the years I’ve worked with thousands
of people in hundreds of companies and this measurement nightmare is commonplace, even typical. The human mind isn’t designed to make sense of such
vast amounts of data. Crows can track three or four people, beyond that they
lose count.* Like crows, we can only hold a limited number of facts in our
minds at one time. We are simply overwhelmed when we try to retain too
much information. One study of information overload found the following
(Waddington, 1996): . Two-thirds of managers report tension with work colleagues, and loss of
job satisfaction because of stress associated with information overload. . One-third of managers su¡er from ill health, as a direct consequence of
stress associated with information overload. This ¢gure increases to 43%
among senior managers. . Almost two-thirds (62%) of managers testify that their personal relationships su¡er as a direct result of information overload. . 43% of managers think important decisions are delayed, and the ability to
make decisions is a¡ected as a result of having too much information. . 44% believe the cost of collating information exceeds its value to business.
What Is Six Sigma? 9
*See Joe Wortham, ‘‘Corvus brachyhynchos,’’ http://www.usd.edu/jwortham/corvus/corvus.html.
Clearly, more information isn’t always better.
When pressed, nearly every executive or manager will admit that there are
a half-dozen or so measurements that really matter. The rest are either derivatives or window dressing. When asked what really interested him, my client
immediately turned to a single slide in the middle of one of the binders.
There were two ‘‘Biggies’’ that he focused on. The second-level drill down
involved a half-dozen major drivers. Tracking this number of metrics is well
within the abilities of humans, if not crows! With this tighter focus the executive could put together a system for selecting good Six Sigma projects and
team members.
Six Sigma activities focus on the few things that matter most to three key constituencies: customers, shareholders, and employees. The primary focus is on
customers, but shareholder interests are not far behind. The requirements of
these two groups are determined using scientific methods, of course. But the
science of identifying what people want is not fully mature, so the data are supplemented with a great deal of personal contact at all levels of the organization.
Employee requirements are also aggressively sought. Well-treated employees
stay longer and do a better job.
DOCUMENTED BENEFITS
Focus comes from two perspectives: down from the top-level goals and up
from problems and opportunities. The opportunities meet the goals at the Six
Sigma project. Six Sigma projects link the activities of the enterprise to its
improvement goals. The linkage is so tight that in a well-run enterprise people
working on Six Sigma projects can tell you which enterprise objectives will be
impacted by their project, and senior leaders are able to measure the impact of
Six Sigma on the enterprise in clear and meaningful terms. The costs and benefits of Six Sigma are monitored using enterprise-wide tracking systems that can
slice and dice the data in many different ways. At any point in time an executive
can determine if Six Sigma is pulling its weight. In many TQM programs of the
past people were unable to point to specific bottom-line benefits, so interest gradually waned and the programs were shelved when times got tough. Six Sigma
organizations know precisely what they’re getting for their investment.
Six Sigma also has an indirect benefit on an enterprise, and one that is seldom measured. That benefit is its impact on the day-to-day way of doing
things. Six Sigma doesn’t operate in a vacuum. When people observe Six
Sigma getting dramatic results, they naturally modify the way they approach
their work. Seat-of-the-pants management doesn’t sit well (pardon the pun!)
in Six Sigma organizations that have reached ‘‘critical mass.’’ Critical mass
occurs when the organization’s culture has changed as a result of Six Sigma
10 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
being successfully deployed in a large segment of the organization. The initial
clash of cultures has worked itself out and those opposed to the Six Sigma
way have either left, converted, or learned to keep quiet.
There is also a ‘‘dark side’’ to Six Sigma that needs to be discussed. There are
parts of the enterprise that don’t lend themselves to scientific rigor. For example, successful R&D involves a good deal of original creative thinking. The
‘‘R’’ (research) part of R&D may actually suffer from too much rigor and the
Six Sigma focus on defects. Cutting edge research is necessarily trial and error
and requires a high tolerance for failure. The chaos of exploring new ideas is
not something to be managed out of the system, it is to be expected and encouraged. To the extent that it involves process design and product testing, Six
Sigma may be able to make a contribution to the ‘‘D’’ (development) part of
R&D. The point is to selectively apply Six Sigma to those areas where it will
provide a benefit.
A second aspect of Six Sigma’s dark side is that some companies obsess on it
to the exclusion of other important aspects of the business. Business is a complex undertaking and leading a business enterprise requires creativity, innovation, and intuition. While it’s all well and good to be ‘‘data driven,’’ leaders
need to heed their inner voice as well. Keep in mind that some of the most
important things are unmeasured and immeasurable. Challenge counterintuitive data and subject it to a gut check. It may be that the counterintuitive result
represents a startling breakthrough in knowledge, but it may simply be wrong.
Here’s an example. A software client had a technical support call center to
help their customers solve problems with the software. Customer surveys were
collected and the statistician made an amazing discovery; hold time didn’t matter! The data showed that customer satisfaction was the same for customers
served immediately and for those on hold for an hour or more. Discussions
began along the lines of how many fewer staff would be required due to this
new information. Impressive savings were forecast.
Fortunately, the support center manager hadn’t left his skepticism at the
front door. He asked for additional data, which showed that the abandon rate
increased steadily as people were kept on hold. The surveys were given only to
those people who had waited for service. These people didn’t mind waiting.
Those who hung up the phone before being served apparently did. In fact,
when a representative sample was obtained, excessive hold time was the number
one complaint.
The change imperative
Six Sigma is not a completely new wayto manage an enterprise, but it isa very
different way. In essence, Six Sigma forces change to occur in a systematic way.
What Is Six Sigma? 11
In traditional organizations the job of management is to design systems to create and deliver value to customers and shareholders. This is, of course, a neverending task. Competitors constantly innovate in an attempt to steal your customers. Customers continuously change their minds about what they want.
Capital markets offer investors new ways to earn a return on their investment.
The result is an imperative to constantly change management systems.
Despite the change imperative, most enterprises resist change until there are
obvious signs that current systems are failing one or more stakeholder groups.
Perhaps declining market share makes it clear that your products or services are
not as competitive as they once were. Or maybe your customers are still loyal,
but customer complaints have reached epidemic proportions. Or your share
price may be trending ominously downward. Traditional organizations watch
for such signs and react to them. Change occurs, as it must, but it does so in an
atmosphere of crisis and confusion. Substantiallossmay resultbeforetheneeded
redesign is complete. People may losetheir jobs or eventheir careers.Many organizations that employ these reactionary tactics don’t survive the shock.
The Six Sigma enterprise proactively embraces change by explicitly incorporating change into their management systems. Full- and part-time change
agent positions are created and a complete infrastructure is created. As contradictory as it sounds, the infrastructure is designed to make change part of the
routine. New techniques are used to monitor changing customer, shareholder,
and employee inputs, and to rapidly integrate the new information by changing
business processes. The approach employs sophisticated computer modeling,
mathematics, and statistical analysis to minimize unneeded tampering by separating signal from noise. These analytical techniques are applied to stakeholder
inputs and to enterprise and process metrics at all levels.
As a consequence of deploying Six Sigma, people require a great deal of training. Communication systems are among the first things that need to be changed
so people know what to make of the new way of doing things. Think about it;
when Six Sigma is deployed the old reports are no longer used. Six Sigma
requires that internal data be presented only if there is a direct linkage to a stakeholder. The phrase ‘‘How do you know?’’ is heard repeatedly. . ‘‘Nice report on on-time deliveries, Joan, but show me why you think this
is important to the customer. If it is, I want to see a chart covering the
last 52 weeks, and don’t forget the control limits.’’ . ‘‘This budget variance report is worthless! I want to see performance
across time, with control limits.’’ . ‘‘Have these employee survey results been validated? What is the reliability of the questions? What are the main drivers of employee satisfaction?
How do you know?’’ . ‘‘How do your dashboards relate to the top-level dashboards?’’
12 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
Add to this the need to do more than simply operate the system you work
with. Six Sigma demands that you constantly look for ways to improve your systems. This often means that systems are eliminated entirely. In the face of this
insecurity, employees watch like a hawk for signs of leadership inconsistency.
Trust is essential. Leaders who don’t communicate a clear and consistent
message and walk the talk will be faced with stiff resistance to Six Sigma.
The need for a well-designed approach to making the transition from a traditional organization to a Six Sigma organization is clear. This is the subject of
Part I of this book. It is the foundation building phase. If it isn’t done properly,
then the DMAIC approach and all of the tools and techniques presented later
in the book will be of little use.
Change agents and their effects on organizations
MANAGING CHANGE
Experts agree: change is difficult, disruptive, expensive, and a major cause of
error. Given these problems, it’s reasonable to ask: Why change? Here are the
most common reasons organizations choose to face the difficulties involved
with change: . LeadershipLSome organizations choose to maintain product or service
leadership as a matter of policy. Change is a routine. . CompetitionLWhen competitors improve their products or services
such that their o¡ering provides greater value than yours, you are forced
to change. Refusal to do so will result in the loss of customers and revenues
and can even lead to complete failure. . Technological advancesLE¡ectively and quickly integrating new technology into an organization can improve quality and e⁄ciency and provide a competitive advantage. Of course, doing so involves changing
management systems. . Training requirementsLMany companies adopt training programs
without realizing that many such programs implicitly involve change.
For example, a company that provides employees with SPC training
should be prepared to implement a process control system. Failure to do
so leads to morale problems and wastes training dollars. . Rules and regulationsLChange can be forced on an organization from
internal regulators via policy changes and changes in operating procedures. Government and other external regulators and rule-makers (e.g.,
ISO for manufacturing, JCAHO for hospitals) can also mandate change. . Customer demandsLCustomers, large and small, have the annoying
habit of refusing to be bound by your policies. The nice customers will
What Is Six Sigma? 13
demand that you change your policy and procedures. The really nasty
customers don’t say anything at all, they simply go somewhere else to do
business.
Johnson (1993b, p. 233) gives the following summary of change management:
1. Change will meet resistance for many di¡erent reasons.
2. Change is a balance between the stable environment and the need to
implement TQM [Six Sigma]. Change can be painful while it provides
many improvements.
3. There are four times change can most readily be made by the leader:
when the leader is new on the job, receives new training, has new technology, or when outside pressures demand change.
4. Leaders must learn to implement change they deem necessary, change
suggested from above their level, and change demanded from above
their level.
5. There are all kinds of reaction to change. Some individuals will resist,
some will accept, and others will have mixed reactions.
6. There is a standard process that supports the implementation of change.
Some of the key requirements for change are leadership, empathy, and
solid communications.
7. It is important that each leader become a change leader. This requires
self-analysis and the will to change those things requiring change.
ROLES
Change requires new behaviors from everyone involved. However, four specific roles commonly appear during most successful change processes
(Hutton, 1994, pp. 2^4): . O⁄cial change agent. An o⁄cially designated person who has primary
responsibility for helping management plan and manage the change process [Sometimes called ‘‘Champions.’’] . Sponsors. Sponsors are senior leaders with the formal authority to legitimize the change. The sponsor makes the change a goal for the organization and ensures that resources are assigned to accomplish it. No
major change is possible without committed and suitably placed sponsors. . Advocate. An advocate for change is someone who sees a need for change
and sets out to initiate the process by convincing suitable sponsors. This
is a selling role. Advocates often provide the sponsor with guidance and
advice. Advocates may or may not hold powerful positions in the organization. . Informal change agent. Persons other than the o⁄cial change agent who
voluntarily help plan and manage the change process. While the contri14 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
bution of these people is extremely important, it is generally not su⁄cient
to cause truly signi¢cant, organization-wide change.
The position of these roles within a typical organizational hierarchy is illustrated graphically in Figure 1.3.
THE JOB OF CHANGE AGENT
Goals
There are three goals of change:
1. Change the way people in the organization think. Helping people change
the way they think is a primary activity of the change agent. All change
beginswiththeindividual, at apersonallevel.Unlesstheindividualiswilling to change his behavior, no real change is possible. Changing behavior
requires a change in thinking. In an organization where people are
expectedto usetheir minds, people’s actions are guided bytheirthoughts
and conclusions. The change agent’s job starts here.
2. Change the norms. Norms consist of standards, models, or patterns
which guide behavior in a group. All organizations have norms or expecWhat Is Six Sigma? 15

Improvement Champions. Copyright # 1994 by David W. Hutton.

tations of their members. Change cannot occur until the organization’s
norms change.
3. Change the organization’s systems or processes. This is the ‘‘meat’’ of the
change. Ultimately, all work is a process and quality improvement
requires change at the process and system level. However, this cannot
occur on a sustained basis until individuals change their behavior and
organizational norms are changed.
Mechanisms used by change agents
The change agents help accomplish the above goals in a variety of ways.
Education and training are important means of changing individual perceptions
and behaviors. In this discussion, a distinction is made between training and
education. Training refers to instruction and practice designed to teach a person
how to perform some task. Training focuses on concretes that need to be done.
Education refers to instruction in how to think. Education focuses on integrating abstract concepts into one’s knowledge of the world. An educated person
will view the world differently after being educated than they did before. This
is an essential part of the process of change.
Change agents help organize an assessment of the organization to identify its
strengths and weaknesses. Change is usually undertaken to either reduce areas
of weakness, or exploit areas of strength. The assessment is part of the education
process. Knowing one’s specific strengths and weaknesses is useful in mapping
the process for change.
Change agents play an important role in quality improvement (remember,
‘‘improvement’’ implies change). As shown in Figure 1.3, change agents are in
strategic positions throughout the organization. This makes it possible for
them to assist in the coordination of the development and implementation of
quality improvement plans. Quality improvement of any significance nearly
always involves multiple departments and levels in the organization.
In the final analysis, all we humans really have to spend is our time. Change
agents see to it that senior management spends sufficient time on the transformation process. Senior managers’ time is in great demand from a large number of people inside and outside of the organization. It is all too easy to
schedule a weekly meeting to discuss ‘‘Six Sigma’’ for an hour, then think you’ve
done your part. In fact, transforming an organization, large or small, requires a
prodigious commitment of the time of senior leadership. At times the executive
will not understand what he or she is contributing by, say, attending team meetings. The change agent must constantly assure the leader that time spent on
transformation activities is time well spent.
16 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
One way of maximizing the value of an executive’s time investment is for the
executive to understand the tremendous power of certain symbolic events.
Some events generate stories that capture the essence of management’s commitment (or lack of it) to the change being undertaken. People repeat stories
and remember them far better than proclamations and statements. For example, there’s a story told by employees of a large U.S. automotive firm that goes
as follows:
In the early 1980s the company was just starting their quality improvement e¡ort. At a meeting between upper management and a famous quality consultant, someone casually mentioned that quality levels were
seasonalLquality was worse in the summer months. The consultant
asked why this should be so. Were di¡erent designs used? Were the
machines di¡erent? How about the suppliers of raw materials? The
answer to each of these questions was ‘‘No.’’ An investigation revealed
that the problem was vacations. When one worker went on vacation,
someone else did her job, but not quite as well. And that ‘‘someone’’ also
vacated a job, which was done by a replacement, etc. It turned out that
the one person going on vacation lead to six people doing jobs they did
not do routinely. The solution was to have a vacation shutdown of two
weeks. This greatly reduced the number of people on new jobs and
brought summer quality levels up to the quality levels experienced the
rest of the year.
This worked ¢ne for a couple of years since there was a recession in the
auto industry and there was plenty of excess capacity. However, one summer the senior executives were asked by the ¢nance department to reconsider their shutdown policy. Demand had picked up and the company
could sell every car it could produce. The accountants pointed out that
the shutdown would cost $100 million per day in lost sales.
The vice president ofthe truck division asked if anything had been done
to address the cause of the quality slippage in the summer. No, nothing
had been done. The president asked the sta¡ ‘‘If we go back to the old policy, would quality levels fall like they did before?’’ Yes, he was told, they
would. ‘‘Then we stay with our current policy and shut down the plants
for vacations,’’ the President announced.
The President was challenged by the vice president of ¢nance. ‘‘I know
we’re committed to quality, but are you sure you want to lose $1.4 billion
in sales just to demonstrate our commitment?’’ The President replied,
‘‘Frank, I’m not doing this to ‘demonstrate’ anything. We almost lost our
company a few years back because our quality levels didn’t match our
overseas competition. Looking at this as a $1.4 billion loss is just the kind
What Is Six Sigma? 17
of short-term thinking that got us in trouble back then. I’m making this
decision to save money.’’
This story had tremendous impact on the managers who heard it, and it
spread like wildfire throughout the organization. It demonstrated many
things simultaneously: senior leadership’s commitment to quality, political
parity between operations and finance, how seemingly harmless policies
can have devastating effects, an illustration of how short-term thinking had
damaged the company in the past, and how long-term thinking worked in a
specific instance, etc. It is a story worth 100 speeches and mission statements.
Leadership support activities
The change agent provides technical guidance to the leadership team. This
guidance takes the form of presenting management with alternative strategies
for pursuing the transformation, education on methods that can be used to
implement the strategies, and selection of key personnel for key transformation
jobs.
Change agents help to monitor the status of quality teams and quality projects relating to the transformation (see Chapter 15 for a complete discussion
of project management). In addition to being a vehicle for local quality improvement, projects can be used as one of the mechanisms for actually implementing
the transformation. If used in this way, it is important that projects be properly
chartered to align the project activities with the goals of the transformation.
All teams, chartered or not, must avoid projects and methods that conflict
with the goals of the transformation. Project team membership must be carefully planned to assure that both task and group maintenance roles are properly
filled. Project charters must clearly identify the scope of the project to prevent
the confusion between teams that results from overlapping charters.
Change agents also serve as coaches to senior leaders. Culture involves innumerable subtle characteristics and behaviors that become unconsciously
‘‘absorbed’’ into one’s being. At times, it is nearly impossible for the individual
executive to see how his or her behavior or relationships are interpreted by
others. The change agent must quietly advise leadership on these issues.
The press of day-to-day business, combined with the inherent difficulties of
change, make it easy to let time slip by without significant progress. Keeping
operations going is a full-time job, and current problems present themselves
with an urgency that meeting a future goal can’t match. Without the constant
reminders from change agents that goals aren’t being met, the leadership can
simply forget about the transformation. It is the change agent’s job to become
18 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
the ‘‘conscience’’ of the leadership and to challenge them when progress falls
short of goals.
Change networks
Change agents should work to develop an internal support network. The network provides resources to support the change process by disseminating education and guidance. The network’s tasks will eventually be subsumed by normal
operations, but in the early stages of the transformation it is vital that the network exist since the control of resources is determined by the existing infrastructure and may be difficult to divert to the change process. Usually, the
members of the network are formal and informal change agents in various
areas of the organization.
Once the network has been established, it is the change agent’s job to assure
that the activities in the network are consistent with and in support of the organization’s vision. For example, if a hospital has a vision where physicians obtain
real-time clinical information and decision support at the patient’s bedside,
then a financially based and centralized information system is inconsistent
with that vision. The change agent, especially the formal change agent, provides
leadership and moral support to network members, who may otherwise feel isolated and vulnerable. Change agents ensure that members of the network
receive the education and guidance they need. Finally, the change agent acts as
a conduit and a stimulant to maintain regular communication in the network.
This may take the form of setting up an email list, scheduling lunches for
network members, etc.
Transforming sta¡ functions
Table 1.1 illustrates the contrast between the way that staff functions used
to operate under the traditional system of management, and the way they can
operate more effectively.
There are several ways in which change agents can assist staff functions in
transforming their roles: . Collaborate with sta¡ functions. . Encourage sta¡ functions to take a proactive approach to change. . Make support functions partners in the support network. . Encourage sta¡ members to become role models. . Help sta¡ functions develop transition plans that are aligned and integrated with the overall transformation plan. . Encourage sta¡ members to share their concerns.
What Is Six Sigma? 19
IMPLEMENTING SIX SIGMA
After nearly two decades of experience with Six Sigma and TQM, there is
now a solid body of scientific research regarding the experience of thousands
of companies implementing major programs such as Six Sigma. Researchers

have foundthat successful deployment of Six Sigma involves focusing on a small
number of high-leverage items. The steps required to successfully implement
Six Sigma are well-documented.
1. Successful performance improvement must begin with senior leadership. Start by providing senior leadership with training in the philosophy, principles, and tools they need to prepare their organization for
success. Using their newly acquired knowledge, senior leaders direct
the development of a management infrastructure to support Six Sigma.
Simultaneously, steps are taken to ‘‘soft-wire’’ the organization and to
cultivate an environment where innovation and creativity can £ourish.
This involves reducing levels of organizational hierarchy, removing procedural barriers to experimentation and change, and a variety of other
changes designed to make it easier to try new things without fear of
reprisal.
2. Systems are developed for establishing close communication with customers, employees, and suppliers. This includes developing rigorous methods of obtaining and evaluating customer, owner, employee, and
supplier input. Base line studies are conducted to determine the starting
point and to identify cultural, policy, and procedural obstacles to
success.
3. Training needs are rigorously assessed. Remedial basic skills education is provided to assure that adequate levels of literacy and numeracy are possessed by all employees. Top-to-bottom training is
conducted in systems improvement tools, techniques, and philosophies.
4. A framework for continuous process improvement is developed, along
with a system of indicators for monitoring progress and success. Six
Sigma metrics focus on the organization’s strategic goals, drivers, and
key business processes.
5. Business processes to be improved are chosen by management, and by
people with intimate process knowledge at all levels of the organization.
Six Sigma projects are conducted to improve business performance
linked to measurable ¢nancial results. This requires knowledge of the
organization’s constraints.
6. Six Sigma projects are conducted by individual employees and teams
lead by Green Belts and assisted by Black Belts.
Although the approach is simple, it is by no means easy. But the results justify the effort expended. Research has shown that firms that successfully
implement Six Sigma perform better in virtually every business category,
including return on sales, return on investment, employment growth, and
share price increase.
Implementing Six Sigma 21
Timetable
Six Sigma’s timeline is usually very aggressive. Typically, companies look for
an improvement rate of approximately 10 every two years, measured in
terms of mistakes or errors using defects per million opportunities (DPMO).*
The subject of DPMO is treated in greater detail elsewhere in this book. For
our purposes here, think of DPMO as the organization’s overall performance
as observed by customers. While calculating this can become very complicated,
for illustration we will look at a very simple example. Assume that you have
the data on key processes in a technical support call center operation shown in
Table 1.2. It is very important to understand that the requirements shown in
this table are derived from customer input. For example, in Table 1.2, the 5 minute hold time requirement assumes that we have surveyed customers and
found that they are willing to accept hold times of 5 minutes or less. Likewise,
we have data to indicate that support engineers rated higher than 5 are acceptable to customers. ‘‘Problem resolved’’ means that the customer told us his
problem was resolved.
A Six Sigma program on a typical timetable would seek to reduce the overall
DPMO from approximately 58,000 to about 5,800 in two years time. This
would improve the sigma level from 3.1 to around 4.0 (see Figure 1.2).
Remember, Six Sigma corresponds to a DPMO of 3.4, so there’s still a way to go.
22 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
*This is about twice the rate of improvement reported by companies using TQM. For example, Baldrige winner Milliken &
Co. implemented a ‘‘ten-four’’ improvement program requiring reductions in key adverse measures by a factor of ten every
four years.

Total 364,000 343,000 57,692 3.1
The time needed to reach Six Sigma performance levels depends on the
organization’s starting point and their level of commitment. Figure 1.4 provides a rough guideline for determining when you will reach Six Sigma,
assuming an aggressive deployment schedule. The times are only approximate, your mileage may vary. Keep in mind that even if the enterprise is
operating at, say, 5 or 6 Sigma overall, there may still be processes operating
at poor sigma levels. Never forget that individual customers judge your
organization based on their individual experiences with you. Relationships
are made one person at a time. For our example, the company can expect
it to take about five years from the time they have deployed Six Sigma to
the time they begin to approach Six Sigma performance levels. If they follow
the deployment timeline shown in Figure 1.4 it will be approximately
seven years altogether. This is not to say that they’ll have to wait seven
years to see results. Results will begin to appear within a year of starting
the deployment.
Implementing Six Sigma 23

Figure 1.4. Time to Reach Six Sigma performance levels.
DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE
Obtaining these revolutionary rates of improvements will not come without
concerted effort. An aggressive deployment plan must be developed. Figure 1.5
shows a typical set of deployment activities and a timetable designed to reach
maturity within two years. This is not to say that the enterprise will be finished
in two years, nor that all of its processes will be operating at Six Sigma performance levels. The organization is never finished! Competition, innovation,
changing customer requirements and a host of other factors will assure that
the quest for excellence is ongoing. However, if the enterprise completes the
tasks depicted in Figure 1.5 the systems and infrastructure needed to keep
them at the cutting edge will have been developed.
The deployment timetable shown in Figure 1.5 will produce sufficient savings to cover its costs during the first year. In the second and subsequent years
the benefits will outpace the costs. The benefit-to-cost ratio will improve as
time goes by. Figure 1.6 shows General Electric’s published data on their Six

Sigma program. Note that in 1996, the first full year of GE’s program, costs and
benefits were approximately equal. The amount by which benefits exceed costs
is increasing because, while costs level out, benefits continue to increase. These
results are consistent with those reported by academic research for companies
which implemented TQM.
Infrastructure
A very powerful feature of Six Sigma is the creation of an infrastructure to
assure that performance improvement activities have the necessary resources.
In this author’s opinion, failure to provide this infrastructure is a major reason
why 80% of all TQM implementations failed in the past. TQM presented general principles and left it to each organization to decide how to put the principles into practice. Companies that did an excellent job of operationalizing the
principles of TQM obtained excellent results, comparable to the results
reported by companies implementing Six Sigma. Those that didn’t, failed. Six
Sigma provides a quasi-standardized set of guidelines for deployment. This is
Implementing Six Sigma 25
Figure 1.6. GE’s reported cost of Six Sigma versus bene¢ts.
why, I believe, Six Sigma enjoys a much higher success rate than TQM. Of
course, there are still those companies that kludge together half-hearted efforts
and call it Six Sigma. They will fail just as those who deployed half-baked
TQM programs failed.
Six Sigma makes improvement and change the full-time job of a small but critical percentage of the organization’s personnel. These full-time change agents
are the catalyst that institutionalizes change. Figure 1.7 illustrates the commitment required by Six Sigma.
Assessing organization culture on quality
Juran and Gryna (1993) define the company quality culture as the opinions,
beliefs, traditions, and practices concerning quality. While sometimes difficult
to quantify, an organization’s culture has a profound effect on the quality
produced by that organization. Without an understanding of the cultural
26 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
Figure 1.7. Six Sigma infrastructure.
aspects of quality, significant and lasting improvements in quality levels are
unlikely.
Two of the most common means of assessing organization culture is the
focus group and the written questionnaire. These two techniques are discussed
in greater detail below. The areas addressed generally cover attitudes, perceptions, and activities within the organization that impact quality. Because of the
sensitive nature of cultural assessment, anonymity is usually necessary. The
author believes that it is necessary for each organization to develop its own set
of questions. The process of getting the questions is an education in itself. One
method for getting the right questions that has produced favorable results in
the past is known as the critical-incident technique. This involves selecting a
small representative sample (n  20) from the group you wish to survey and
asking open-ended questions, such as:
‘‘Which of our organization’s beliefs, traditions and practices have a
bene¢cial impact on quality?’’
‘‘Which of our organization’s beliefs, traditions and practices have a detrimental impact on quality?’’
The questions are asked by interviewers who are unbiased and the respondents are guaranteed anonymity. Although usually conducted in person or
by phone, written responses are sometimes obtained. The order in which the
questions are asked (beneficial/detrimental) is randomized to avoid bias in
the answer. Interviewers are instructed not to prompt the respondent in any
way. It is important that the responses be recorded verbatim, using the
respondent’s own words. Participants are urged to provide as many responses
as they can; a group of 20 participants will typically produce 80^100
responses.
The responses themselves are of great interest and always provide a great deal
of information. In addition, the responses can be grouped into categories and
the categories examined to glean additional insight into the dimensions of the
organization’s quality culture. The responses and categories can be used to
develop valid survey items and to prepare focus-group questions. The followup activity is why so few people are needed at this stageLstatistical validity is
obtained during the survey stage.
LEADERSHIP
Six Sigma involves changing major business value streams that cut across
organizational barriers. It provides the means by which the organization’s strategic goals are to be achieved. This effort cannot be lead by anyone other than
the CEO, who is responsible for the performance of the organization as a
Implementing Six Sigma 27
whole. Six Sigma must be implemented from the top down. Lukewarm leadership endorsement is the number 1 cause of failed Six Sigma attempts.
Conversely, I don’t know of a single case where top leadership fully embraced
Six Sigma (or TQM, for that matter) that hasn’t succeeded. Six Sigma has zero
chance of success when implemented without leadership from the top. This
is because of the Six Sigma focus on cross-functional, even enterprise-wide
processes. Six Sigma is not about local improvements, which are the only
improvements possible when top-level support is lacking.
CHAMPIONS AND SPONSORS
Six Sigma champions are high-level individuals who understand Six Sigma
and are committed to its success. In larger organizations Six Sigma will be
lead by a full-time, high-level champion, such as an Executive Vice President.
In all organizations, champions also include informal leaders who use Six
Sigma in their day-to-day work and communicate the Six Sigma message at
every opportunity. Sponsors are owners of processes and systems who help
initiate and coordinate Six Sigma improvement activities in their areas of
responsibilities.
BLACK BELT
Candidates for Black Belt status are technically oriented individuals held in
high regard by their peers. They should be actively involved in the process of
organizational change and development. Candidates may come from a wide
range of disciplines and need not be formally trained statisticians or analysts.
However, because they are expected to master a wide variety of technical tools
in a relatively short period of time, Black Belt candidates will probably possess
a background in college-level mathematics, the basic tool of quantitative analysis. Coursework in statistical methods should be considered a strong plus or
even a prerequisite. As part of their training, Black Belts typically receive 160
hours of classroom instruction, plus one-on-one project coaching from Master
Black Belts or consultants. The precise amount of training varies considerably
from firm to firm. In the financial sector Black Belts generally receive three
weeks of training, while Black Belts in large research facilities may get as much
as six weeks of training.
Successful candidates will be comfortable with computers. At a minimum,
they should be proficient with one or more operating systems, spreadsheets,
database managers, presentation programs, and word processors. As part of
their training they will also be required to become proficient in the use of one
or more advanced statistical analysis software packages and probably simula28 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
tion software. Six Sigma Black Belts work to extract actionable knowledge from
an organization’s information warehouse. To assure access to the needed information, Six Sigma activities should be closely integrated with the information
systems of the organization. Obviously, the skills and training of Six Sigma
Black Belts must be enabled by an investment in software and hardware. It
makes no sense to hamstring these experts by saving a few dollars on computers
or software.
GREEN BELT
Green Belts are Six Sigma project leaders capable of forming and facilitating
Six Sigma teams and managing Six Sigma projects from concept to completion
Green Belt training consists of five days of classroom training and is conducted
in conjunction with Six Sigma projects. Training covers project management,
quality management tools, quality control tools, problem solving, and descriptive data analysis. Six Sigma champions should attend Green Belt training.
Usually, Six Sigma Black Belts help Green Belts define their projects prior to
the training, attend training with their Green Belts, and assist them with their
projects after the training.
MASTER BLACK BELT
This is the highest level of technical and organizational proficiency. Master
Black Belts provide technical leadership of the Six Sigma program. Thus,
they must know everything the Black Belts knows, as well as additional skills
vital to the success of the Six Sigma program. The additional skill might be
deep understanding of the mathematical theory on which the statistical methods are based. Or, perhaps, a gift for project management, coaching skills to
help Black Belts, teaching skills, or program organization at the enterprise
level. Master Black Belts must be able to assist Black Belts in applying the
methods correctly in unusual situations, especially advanced statistical methods. Whenever possible, statistical training should be conducted only by qualified Master Black Belts or equivalently skilled consultants. If it becomes
necessary for Black Belts and Green Belts to provide training, they should
only do so under the guidance of Master Black Belts. Otherwise the familiar
‘‘propagation of error’’ phenomenon will occur, i.e., Black Belt trainers pass
on errors to Black Belt trainees who pass them on to Green Belts, who pass
on greater errors to team members. Because of the nature of the Master’s
duties, all Master Black Belts must possess excellent communication and
teaching skills.
Implementing Six Sigma 29
STAFFING LEVELS AND EXPECTED RETURNS
As stated earlier in this chapter, the number of full-time personnel devoted to
Six Sigma is not large as a percentage of the total work force. Mature Six Sigma
programs, such as those of General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, AlliedSignal,
and others average about one percent of their workforce as Black Belts, with
considerable variation in that number. There is usually about one Master
Black Belt for every ten Black Belts, or about one Master Black Belt per 1,000
employees. A Black Belt will typically complete 5 to 7 projects per year, usually
working with teams. Project teams are often lead by Green Belts, who, unlike
Black Belts and Master Black Belts, are not employed full time in the Six
Sigma program. Green Belts usually devote between 5 and 10 percent of their
time to Six Sigma project work.
Black Belts are highly prized employees and are often recruited for key management positions elsewhere in the company. After Six Sigma has been in place
for three or more years, the number of former Black Belts in management positions tends to be greater than the number of active Black Belts. These people
take the rigorous, customer-driven, process-focused Six Sigma approach with
themwhentheymovetonewjobs.The ‘‘SixSigmaway’’ soonbecomespervasive.
Estimated savings per project vary from organization to organization.
Reported results average about $150,000 to $243,000. Some industries just starting their Six Sigma programs average as high as $700,000 savings per project,
although these projects usually take longer. Note that these are not the huge
mega-projects pursued by reengineering. Still, by completing 5 to 7 projects
per year per Black Belt the company will add in excess of $1 million per year
per Black Belt to its bottom line. For a company with 1,000 employees the
numbers would look something like this:
Master Black Belts: 1
Black Belts: 10
Projects: 50 to 70 (5 to 7 per Black Belt)
Estimated saving: $9 million to $14.6 million (i.e., $14,580 savings
per employee)
Do the math for your organization and see what Six Sigma could do for you.
Because Six Sigma savingsLunlike traditional slash and burn cost cuttingL
impact only non-value-added costs, they flow directly to your company’s bottom line. Traditional, income-statement based cost cutting inevitably hurts
value-adding activities. As a result, the savings seldom measure up to expectations and revenues often suffer as well. The predicted bottom-line impact is
not actually realized. Firms engaging in these activities hurt their prospects for
future success and delay their recovery.
30 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
Six Sigma deployment and management
Six Sigma deployment is the actual creation of an organization that embodies
the Six Sigma philosophy. Doing this involves asking a series of questions,
then answering these questions for organizational units. The deployment process is outlined in Figure 1.8.
Creating an organization to carry out this process is no easy task. Traditional
organizations are structured to carry out routine tasks, while Six Sigma is all
about non-routine activity. Look at the action words in Figure 1.8: improve,
increase, eliminate, reduce, breakthrough. These are challenging things to do in
any environment, and nearly impossible in an enterprise focused on carrying
out routine assignments. The job of the leadership team is totransformthe organization’s culture so that Six Sigma will flourish. It’s a tough job, but not an
impossible one. Think of it as writing a book. No one sits down and writes a
book as a single unit. Books are organized into smaller sub-units, such as sections, chapters, pages, and paragraphs. Similarly, deploying Six Sigma involves
sub-units, such as those shown in Figure 1.9.
Although leadership is ultimately responsible for creating the Six Sigma
Deployment Manual, they will not have the time to write it themselves.
Writing the manual is itself a project, and it should be treated as such. A formal
charter should be prepared and responsibility for writing the deployment manual should be assigned by senior leadership to a project sponsor. The sponsor
should be a senior leader, either the CEO or a member of the CEO’s staff. An
aggressive deadline should be set. The plan itself is the deliverable, and the
requirements should be clearly defined. The CEO and the Executive Six Sigma
Council must formally accept the plan.
All of the subjects in the table of contents in Figure 1.9 are discussed in this
book. Some are covered in several pages, while others take an entire chapter or
more. Although you won’t be able to get all of your answers from a single
book, or from any number of books, the material you will find here should
give you enough information to start the journey. You will encounter enough
challenges along the way that perhaps the word ‘‘adventure’’ would be more
appropriate!
Six Sigma communication plan
Successful implementation of Six Sigma will only happen if the leadership’s
vision and implementation plans are clearly understood and embraced by
employees, shareholders, customers, and suppliers. Because it involves cultural
change, Six Sigma frightens many people. Good communications are an antidote to fear. Without it rumors run rampant and morale suffers. Although

change is the byword of Six Sigma, you should try to cause as little unnecessary
disruption as possible. At the same time, the commitment of the enterprise to
Six Sigma must be clearly and unambiguously understood throughout the organization. This doesn’t happen by accident, it is the result of careful planning
and execution.
Responsibility for the communication process should be determined and
assigned at the outset. The communication process owner will be held
accountable by the Executive Six Sigma Council for the development and
oversight of the communication plan. This may include impact on the process
owner’s compensation and/or bonus, or other financial impact. Of course,
the owner will need to put together a team to assist with the efforts.
Development of the communication plan is a subproject, so the communication process owner will report to the sponsor of the overall Six Sigma deployment activity.
The communication plan must identify the communication needs for each
stakeholder group in the enterprise. Significant stakeholder groups include,
but are not limited to, the following: . Key customers . Shareholders or other owners . Senior leadership . Middle management . Six Sigma change agents . The general employee population . Suppliers
METRICS
Metrics are, of course, a vital means of communication. Six Sigma metrics
are discussed in detail elsewhere in this book. Suffice it to say here that Six

scorecard is like the instrument panel in the cockpit of an airplane. It displays
information that provides a complete view of the way the organization
appears to its customers and shareholders, as well as a picture of key internal
processes and the rate of improvement and innovation. Balanced scorecards
also provide the means of assuring that Six Sigma projects are addressing
key business issues.
COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA
Communicating the Six Sigma message is a multimedia undertaking. The
modern organization has numerous communications technologies at its disposal. Keep in mind that communication is a two-way affair; be sure to provide numerous opportunities for upward and lateral as well as downward
communication. Here are some suggestions to accomplish the communications mission: . All-hands launch event, with suitable pomp and circumstance . Mandatory sta¡ meeting agenda item .

COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS AND
RESPONSIBILITIES
For each group, the communication process owner should determine the
following:
1. Who is primarily responsible for communication with this group?
2. What are the communication needs for this group? For example, key
customers may need to know how Six Sigma will bene¢t them; employees may need to understand the process for applying for a change agent
position such as Black Belt.
3. What communicationtools, techniques and methods will be used? These
include meetings, newsletters, email, one-on-one communications, web
sites, etc.
4. What will be the frequency of communication? Remember, repetition
will usually be necessary to be certain the message is received and understood.
5. Who is accountable for meeting the communication requirement?
6. How will we measure the degree of success? Who will do this?
The requirements and responsibilities can be organized using tables, such as
Table 1.3.
Six Sigma organizational roles and responsibilities
Six Sigma is the primary enterprise strategy for process improvement. To
make this strategy a success it is necessary not only to implement Six Sigma,
but also to institutionalize it as a way of doing business. It is not enough to
train a few individuals to act as champions for Six Sigma. To the contrary, such
a plan virtually guarantees failure by placing the Six Sigma activities somewhere
other than the mainstream. After all, isn’t process improvement an ongoing
part of the business?
LEADERSHIP ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Leadership’s primary role is to create a clear vision for Six Sigma success and
to communicate their vision clearly, consistently, and repeatedly throughout
the organization. In other words, leadership must lead the effort.
The primary responsibility of leadership is to assure that Six Sigma goals,
objectives, and progress are properly aligned with those of the enterprise as a
whole. This is done by modifying the organization in such a way that personnel
naturally pursue Six Sigma as part of their normal routine. This requires the
creation of new positions and departments, and modifying the reward, recogniImplementing Six Sigma 35

tion, incentive, and compensation systems for other positions. Leadership must
decide such key issues as: . How will leadership organize to support Six Sigma? (E.g., Executive Six
Sigma Council, designation of an executive Six Sigma champion, creation
of Director of Six Sigma, where will the new Six Sigma function report?
Etc.) . At what rate do we wish to make the transition from a traditional to a Six
Sigma enterprise? . What will be our resource commitment to Six Sigma? . What new positions will be created? To whom will they report? . Will Six Sigma be a centralized or a decentralized function? . What level of ROI validation will we require? . How will Six Sigma be integrated with other process excellence initiatives,
such as Lean? . Will we create a cross-functional core team to facilitate deployment? Who
will be on the team? To whom will they be accountable? . How will leadership monitor the success of Six Sigma? . How will executive support of Six Sigma be assessed?
TYPICAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Although each organization will develop its own unique approach to Six
Sigma, it is helpful to know how successful companies have achieved their
success. Most importantly, successful Six Sigma deployment is always a topdown affair. I know of no case where Six Sigma has had a major impact on
overall enterprise performance that was not fully embraced and actively
lead by top management. Isolated efforts at division or department levels
are doomed from the outset. Like flower gardens in a desert, they may flourish and produce a few beautiful results for a time, but sustaining the results
requires immense effort by local heroes in constant conflict with the mainstream culture, placing themselves at risk. Sooner or later, the desert will
reclaim the garden. Six Sigma shouldn’t require heroic effortLthere are
never enough heroes to go around. Once top management has accepted its
leadership responsibility the organizational transformation process can
begin.
A key decision is whether Black Belts will report to a central Six Sigma
organization or to managers located elsewhere in the organization. The
experience of most successful Six Sigma enterprises is that centralized reporting is best. Internal studies by one company that experimented with both
types of reporting revealed the results shown in Table 1.4. The major reason
for problems with the decentralized approach was disengaging people from
Implementing Six Sigma 37
routine work and firefighting. Six Sigma is devoted to change, and it seems
change tends to take a back seat to current problems. To be sure, the Black
Belt possesses a skill set that can be very useful in putting out fires. Also,
Black Belts tend to be people who excel at what they do. This combination
makes it difficult to resist the urge to pull the Black Belt off of his or her projects ‘‘just for a while.’’ In fact, some organizations have trouble getting the
Black Belt out of their current department and into the central organization.
In one case the CEO intervened personally on behalf of the Black Belts to
break them loose. Such stories are testimony to the difficulties encountered
in making drastic cultural changes.
The transformation process involves new roles and responsibilities on the
part of many individuals in the organization. In addition, new change agent
positions must be created. Table 1.5 lists some typical roles and responsibilities.
Obviously, the impact on budgets, routines, existing systems, etc. is substantial. Six Sigma is not for the faint-hearted. It isn’t hard to see why it takes a
number of years for Six Sigma to become ‘‘mature.’’ The payoff, however,
makes the effort worthwhile. Half-hearted commitments take nearly as much
effort and produce negligible results, or even negative impacts.
Selecting the ‘‘Belts’’
Past improvement initiatives, such as TQM, shared much in common with
Six Sigma. TQM also had management champions, improvement projects,
sponsors, etc. One of the main differences in the Six Sigma infrastructure is
the creation of more formally defined change agent positions. Some observers
criticize this practice as creating corps of ‘‘elites,’’ especially Black Belts and
Master Black Belts. However, I believe this criticism is invalid. Let’s examine

from leadership. When this approach was actually tried in America in the
1970s the results were disappointing. The originators of the quality circles
idea, the Japanese, reported considerably greater success with the
approach. This was no doubt due to the fact that Japanese circles were
integrated into decades old company-wide process improvement activities, while American ¢rms typically implemented circles by themselves.
Indeed, when Six Sigma deployments reach a high level of maturity,
more extensive training is often successful. . Trainthe managers. This involvestraining senior and middle management
in change agent skills. This isn’t a bad idea of itself. However, if the basic
structure of the organization doesn’t change, there is no clear way to
apply the newly acquired skills. Training in and of itself does nothing to
change an organization’s environment. Historically, trained managers
return to pretty much the same job. As time goes by their skills atrophy
and their self-con¢dence wanes. If opportunities to apply their knowledge
do arise, they often fail to recognize it or, if they do recognize it, fail to correctly apply the approach. This is natural for a person trying to do something di¡erent for the ¢rst time. The full-time change agents in Six Sigma
learn by doing. By the end of their tenure, they can con¢dently apply Six
Sigma methodology to a wide variety of situations. . Use the experts in other areas. The tools of Six Sigma are not new. In fact,
Industrial Statisticians, ASQ Certi¢ed Quality Engineers, Certi¢ed
Reliability Engineers, Certi¢ed Quality Technicians, Systems Engineers,
Industrial Engineers, Manufacturing Engineers and other specialists
already possess a respectable level of expertise in many Six Sigma tools.
Some have a level of mastery in some areas that exceeds that of Black
Belts. However, being a successful change agent involves a great deal
more than mastery of technical tools. Black Belts, Green Belts, and
Master Black Belts learn tools and techniques in the context of following
the DMAIC approach to drive organizational change. This is very di¡erent than using the same techniques in routine daily work. Quality analysts, for example, generally work in the quality department as
permanent, full-time employees. They report to a single boss and have
well-de¢ned areas of responsibility. Black Belts, in contrast, go out and
seek projects rather than work on anything routine. They report to many
di¡erent people, who use di¡erent criteria to evaluate the Black Belt’s performance. They are accountable for delivering measurable, bottom-line
results. Obviously, the type of person who is good at one job may not be
suitable for the other. . Create permanent change agent positions. Another optiontothe Black Belt
position is to make the job permanent. After all, why not make maximum
44 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
use of the training by keeping the person in the Black Belt job inde¢nitely?
Furthermore, as Black Belts gain experience they become more pro¢cient
at completing projects. There are, however, arguments against this
approach.Havingtemporary Black Belts allowsmore peopleto gothrough
the position, thus increasing the number of people in management with
Black Belt experience. Since Black Belts work on projects that impact
many di¡erent areas of the enterprise, they have a broad, process-oriented
perspective that is extremely valuable in top management positions. The
continuous in£ux of new blood into Black Belt and Green Belt positions
keeps the thinking fresh and prevents the ‘‘them-versus-us’’ mentality that
often develops withinfunctional units. New Black Belts have di¡erent networks of contacts throughout the organization, which leads to projects in
areasthat might otherwise be missed. Permanent Black Belts would almost
certainly be moreheavily in£uenced bytheirfull-time bossthantemporary
Black Belts, thus leading to a more provincial focus.
BLACK BELTS
There are usually many more Black Belt candidates than there are positions.
Thus, although there are minimum requirements, those selected generally
exceed the minimums by a considerable degree. The process for selecting Black
Belts should be clearly defined. This assures consistency and minimizes the
possibility of bias and favoritism.
The next question is, what’s important to the success of a Black Belt? I
worked with a group of consultants and Master Black Belts to answer this question. We came up with a list of seven success factors, then used Expert Choice
2000 software* to calculate relative importance weights for each category. The
results are shown in Figure 1.10.
The weights are, of course, subjective and only approximate. You may feel
free to modify them if you feel strongly that they’re incorrect. Better yet, you
may want to identify your own set of criteria and weights. The important thing
is to determine the criteria and then develop a method of evaluating candidates
on each criterion. The sum of the candidate’s criterion score times the criterion
weight will give you an overall numerical assessment that can be useful in sorting out those candidates with high potential from those less likely to succeed
as Black Belts. Of course, the numerical assessment is not the only input into
the selection decision, but it is a very useful one.
Implementing Six Sigma 45
*Expert Choice 2000 is a software package that converts pairwise comparisons into relative weights using the Analytic
Hierarchy Process. The AHP is described elsewhere in this book. See http://www.expertchoice.com/ for details.
You may be surprised to see the low weight given to math skills. The rationale is that Black Belts will receive 200 hours of training, much of it focused
on the practical application of statistical techniques using computer software
and requiring very little actual mathematics. Software automates the analysis,
making math skills less necessary. The mathematical theory underlying a technique is not discussed beyond the level necessary to help the Black Belt properly apply the tool. Black Belts who need help with a particular tool have
access to Master Black Belts, other Black Belts, consultants, professors, and
a wealth of other resources. Most statistical techniques used in Six Sigma are
relatively straightforward and often graphical; spotting obvious errors is
usually not too difficult for trained Black Belts. Projects seldom fail due to a
lack of mathematical expertise. In contrast, the Black Belt will often have to
rely on their own abilities to deal with the obstacles to change they will inevitably encounter. Failure to overcome the obstacle will often spell failure of
the entire project.
Figure 1.11 provides an overview of a process for the selection of Black Belt
candidates.

Final Candidate Selection
To ensure that the Black Belts will be able to address enterprise-wide issues and
processes, the Director of Six Sigma and the Executive Six Sigma Council will determine the number of Black Belts to be trained in each functional area, division, department, etc. Black Belt candidates are ranked using a system of points assigned during
the screening process. Rank-ordered lists of Black Belt candidates are prepared for
designated areas and presented to the senior management of the area for final selection. Area management nominates candidates from their list in numbers sufficient to fill
the spaces allocated by the Director of Six Sigma and the Executive Six Sigma
Council.
Commitment to Black Belt Assignment
Selected candidates are required to attend 200 hours of Black Belt training (see
Chapter 4 for the training content). Within one year of completing training, the
Black Belt candidate is required to become certified by passing a written examination
and successfully completing at least two major projects. (See the Appendix for
detailed Black Belt certification process information.) The Black Belt is assigned to
Six Sigma full time as a Black Belt for a minimum period of 2 full years, measured
from the time he or she is certified as a Black Belt.
Reintegration of Black Belts into the Organization
Black Belts are employed in the Black Belt role for two or three years. After that time
they leave the Six Sigma organization and return to other duties. Accomplishing this
transition is the joint responsibility of the Black Belt, the Director of Six Sigma, and the
management of the Black Belt’s former department. Collectively this group comprises
the ‘‘Transition Team’’ for the Black Belt. However, senior leadership must accept
ultimate responsibility for assuring that Black Belts are not ‘‘homeless’’ after completing their Black Belt tour of duty.
The Director of Six Sigma will inform the Black Belt at least six months prior to the
scheduled return. The Black Belt should maintain contact with their ‘‘home’’ organization during his tenure in Six Sigma. If it appears that there will be a suitable position
available at approximately the time the Black Belt is scheduled to return, arrangements should be made to complete or hand-off the Black Belt’s Six Sigma projects in
preparation for his return. If no suitable openings will be available, the Transition
Team needs to develop alternative plans. Alternatives might include extending the
Black Belt’s term of service in Six Sigma, looking for openings in other areas, or
making temporary arrangements.
Figure 1.11. Black Belt candidate selection process and criteria.
GREEN BELTS
Green Belts are change agents who work part time on process improvement. The bulk of the Green Belt’s time is spent performing their normal
work duties. Although most experts (including me) advocate that the Green
Belt spend 10% to 20% of their time on projects, the time a typical Green
Belt spends on projects in a given year is more like 2% to 5%. A Green Belt
will usually complete one or two major projects per year. Also, unlike Black
Belt projects, Green Belt projects may address processes that are not crossfunctional. Few Green Belt projects cover enterprise-wide processes.
However, since there are usually more Green Belts than Black Belts by a factor of 2 to 5, these Green Belt projects have a tremendous impact on
the enterprise. Also, it is common to have a Black Belt coordinating a ‘‘portfolio’’ of ‘‘Green Belt projects’’* that, taken together, cover a cross-functional
process.
Figure 1.12 provides an overview of a process for the selection of Green Belt
candidates.
MASTER BLACK BELTS
Master Black Belts are recruited from the ranks of Black Belts. The process
is usually less formal and less well defined than that for Black Belts or
Green Belts and there is a great deal of variability between companies.
Master Black Belt candidates usually make their interest known to Six
Sigma leadership. Leadership selects candidates based on the needs of the
enterprise and Six Sigma’s role in meeting those needs. For example, in the
early stages of deployment Master Black Belt candidates with excellent organizational skills and the ability to communicate the leadership’s Six Sigma
vision may be preferred. Intermediate deployments might favor candidates
who excel at project selection and Black Belt coaching. Mature Six Sigma programs might look for Master Black Belts with training ability and advanced
statistical know-how. Master Black Belts often have advanced technical
degrees and extensive Black Belt experience. Many organizations provide
Master Black Belts with additional training. Certification requirements for
Master Black Belts varies with the organization. Many organizations do not
certify Master Black Belts.
48 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
*Personally, I would prefer that the term ‘‘Six Sigma project’’ be used instead of Black Belt project or Green Belt project.
However, I bow to common usage in this book.
Integrating Six Sigma and related initiatives
At any given time most companies have numerous activities underway to
improve their operations. For example, the company might be pursuing one or
more of the following: . TQM . Lean manufacturing . Lean service . Continuous improvement . Kaizen . Business process reengineering . Theory of constraints . Variation reduction
The list can be extended indefinitely. Six Sigma can’t simply be thrown into
the mix without causing tremendous confusion. People will find themselves in
conflict with one another over jurisdiction, resources, and authority.
Leadership must give careful thought as to how the various overlapping activities can best be organized to optimize their impact on performance. An
‘‘umbrella concept’’ often provides the needed guidance to successfully integrate the different but related efforts. One concept that I’ve found to be particularly useful is that of ‘‘Process Excellence’’ (PE).

Final Candidate Selection
Based on the organizational need for Green Belts, as determined by the Director of
Six Sigma and the Executive Six Sigma Council, Green Belt training allotments are
provided to Master Black Belts, Black Belts and/or General Managers. Green Belt
candidacy requires the consent of the candidate’s management.
Commitment
Each Green Belt candidate selected will be required to complete a 40 hour Green Belt
training course, and to lead at least one successful Six Sigma project every 12
months, or participate on at least two successful Six Sigma projects every 12 months.
Green Belt certification is accomplished as described in the Appendix.
Figure 1.12. Green Belt candidate selection process and criteria.
WHAT IS PROCESS EXCELLENCE?
Organizations are typically designed along functional lines. Functions,
such as engineering, marketing, accounting, manufacturing, and so on are
assigned responsibility for certain tasks. The functions tend to correspond closely to university degree programs. Persons with higher education in a functional area specialize in the work assigned to the function. General
management and finance allocate resources to each function based on the
needs of the enterprise.
If the enterprise is to be successful the ‘‘needs of the enterprise’’ must be
based on the needs of its customers. However, customers typically obtain
value not from organizational functions but from products or services that are
created by the cooperative efforts and resources of many different functional
areas. Most customers couldn’t care less about how the enterprise creates the
values they are purchasing.* A similar discussion applies to owners and shareholders. In fact, there is a substantial body of opinion among management
experts that focusing internally on functional concerns can be detrimental to
the enterprise as a whole. An alternative is to focus on the process or value
stream that creates and delivers value.
A process focus means that stakeholder values are determined and activities are classified as either relating to the creation of the final value (valueadded activity) or not (non-value-added activity). Processes are evaluated on
how effectively and efficiently they create value. Effectiveness is defined as
delivering what the customer requires, or exceeding the requirements; it
encompasses quality, price, delivery, timeliness and everything else that goes
into perceived value. Efficiency is defined as being effective using a minimum
of resources; more of an owner’s perspective. Excellent processes are those
that are both effective and efficient.
PE is the set of activities specifically designed to create excellent processes.
PE is change-oriented and cross-functional. It includes Six Sigma, all of the
initiatives listed earlier, and many more as well. By creating a top-level position for PE, leadership assigns clear responsibility for this important work.
The PE leader, usually a Vice President, leads a Process Excellence
Leadership Team (PELT) which includes functional leaders as well as fulltime PE personnel such as the Director of Six Sigma. The VP of PE isn’t
responsible for particular processes, but she has the authority to identify key
processes and nominate owners for approval by the CEO or the PELT.
Examples of processes include:

Deployment to the supply chain
In the early part of the twentieth century Henry Ford pursued a great vision
by building the Ford River Rouge Complex. By 1927 the Rouge was handling
all production of Ford automobiles. It was truly a marvel. The Rouge was the
largest single manufacturing complex in the United States, with peak employment of about 120,000. Here Henry Ford achieved self-sufficiency and vertical
integration in automobile production, a continuous work flow from iron ore
and other raw materials to finished automobiles. The complex included dock
facilities, blast furnaces, open-hearth steel mills, foundries, a rolling mill, metal
stamping facilities, an engine plant, a glass manufacturing building, a tire
plant, and its own power house supplying steam and electricity.
On June 2, 1978, the Rouge was listed a National Historic Landmark. From
state-of-the-art wonder to historical curiosity in just fifty years.
A related historical artifact is the idea that a firm can produce quality products or services by themselves. This may’ve been the case in the heyday of the
Rouge, when the entire ‘‘supply chain’’ was a single, vertically integrated behemoth entity, but it is certainly no longer true. In today’s world fully 50^80% of
the cost of a manufactured product is in purchased parts and materials. When
the customer forks over her good money for your product, she doesn’t differentiate between you and your suppliers.
Implementing Six Sigma 51
You say you’re not in manufacturing? The situation is the same for you. Say,
for example, your product is personal finance software. Your customer runs
your software on a computer you didn’t design with an operating system you
have no control over. They’re using your software to access their account at
their financial institution to complete a tax return, which they’ll file electronically with the IRS. When your customers click the icon to run your product,
they consider all of these intermediaries to be part of the value they are paying
to receive.
The service industry is no different. Let’s say you are a discount brokerage
company. Your customers want to be able to use your service to buy common
stocks, fixed income instruments, derivatives, etc. They also want debit cards,
check writing, bill paying, pension plans, and a variety of other services. Oh,
and don’t forget financial advice, investment portfolio analysis, and annuities.
When your customers put their money into their account at your firm, they
expect you to be responsible for making all of the ‘‘third parties’’ work together
seamlessly.
In short, you’ll never reach Six Sigma quality levelswiththree sigma suppliers.
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SIX SIGMA ROLES
AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Your primary mission inthe supplier Six Sigma activity isto obtain Six Sigma
supplier quality with minimal costs. In pursuit of this mission you will initiate
a number of Six Sigma projects that involve suppliers. The organization responsible for supply chain management (SCM) will take the lead in developing the
supplier Six Sigma program. Leadership includes preparing the Supplier Six
Sigma Deployment Plan. The plan should include the following: . Policies on supplier Six Sigma . Goals and deliverables of the supplier Six Sigma program . Supplier communication plan . Timetable for deployment, including phases (e.g., accelerated deployment
to most critical suppliers) . Procedures de¢ning supplier contact protocols, supplier project charter,
supplier project reporting and tracking, etc. . Training requirements and timeline . Methods of assessing supplier Six Sigma e¡ectiveness . Integration of the supplier Six Sigma program and in-house activities
SCM receives guidance from the Executive Six Sigma Council and the Six
Sigma organization. The Six Sigma organization often provides expertise and
other resources to the supplier Six Sigma effort.
52 BUILDING THE SIX SIGMA INFRASTRUCTURE
SCM should sponsor or co-sponsor supplier Six Sigma projects. In some
cases SCM will lead the projects, often with supplier personnel taking a coleadership role. In others they will assist Black Belts or Green Belts working
on other projects that involve suppliers. Full SCM sponsorship is usually
required when the project’s primary focus is on the supplier’s product or process. For example, a Six Sigma project chartered to reduce the number of
late deliveries of a key product. Projects involving suppliers, but not focused
on them, can be co-sponsored by SCM. For example, a project involving the
redesign of an order fulfillment process that requires minor changes to the
supplier’s web ordering form. SCM assistance can take a number of different
forms, e.g.: . Acting as a liaison between the internal team members and suppliers . Negotiating funding and budget authority for supplier Six Sigma projects . Estimating and reporting supplier project savings . Renegotiating contract terms . Resolving con£icts . De¢ning responsibility for action items . Scheduling supplier visits . De¢ning procedures for handling of proprietary supplier information . Responding to supplier requests for assistance with Six Sigma
In addition to SCM, other elements within your organization play important
supporting roles. Usually Black Belts will come from the Six Sigma organization, although some larger enterprises assign a team of Black Belts to work on
SCM projects full time. Green Belts often come from organizations sponsoring
supplier-related projects. Team members are assigned from various areas, as
with any Six Sigma project.
SUPPLIER RESPONSIBILITIES
Never forget that the supplier’s processes are owned and controlled by the
supplier, not by you. As the customer you certainly have the final say in the
requirements, but ultimate responsibility for the process itself should remain
with the supplier. To do otherwise may have legal ramifications, such as liability
and warranty implications. Besides these issues is the simple human tendency
of caring less when someone else is responsible. Six Sigma teams also need to
be careful about making it clearthatonly SCM hasthe authorityto make official
requests for change. It can be embarrassing if a Black Belt makes a suggestion
that the supplier believes to be a formal requirement to change. SCM may
receive a new bid, price change, complaint letter, etc. from the supplier over
such misunderstandings. Supplier relationships are often quite fragile and
‘‘Handle with care’’ is a good motto for the entire Six Sigma team to follow.
Implementing Six Sigma 53
In addition to accepting responsibility for their processes, suppliers must
often take the lead role in Six Sigma teams operating in supplier facilities.
Supplier leadership must support Six Sigma efforts within their organizations.
Suppliers must agree to commit the resources necessary to successfully complete projects, including personnel and funding.
CHANGE AGENT COMPENSATION AND RETENTION
Experienced Certified Black Belts and Master Black Belts are in great
demand throughout the manufacturing and services sectors.* Small wonder.
Here are people who have proven that they can effect meaningful change in a
complex environment. Since organizations exist in a competitive world, steps
must be taken to protect the investment in these skilled change agents, or they
will be lured away by other organizations, perhaps even competitors. The most
common (and effective) actions involve compensation and other financial
incentives, such as: . Bonuses . Stock options . Results sharing . Payment of dues to professional societies . Pay increases
There are also numerous non-financial and quasi-financial rewards. For
example, Black Belts reentering the workforce after their tour of duty often
enter positions that pay significantly higher than the ones they left when becoming Black Belts. In fact, in some companies the Black Belt position is viewed as
a step on the fast track to upper management positions. Also, change is ‘‘news’’
and it is only natural that the names of Master Black Belts and Black Belts
involved in major change initiatives receive considerable publicity on company
web sites as well as in newsletters, recognition events, project fairs, etc. Even if
they don’t receive formal recognition, Six Sigma projects often generate a great
deal of internal excitement and discussion. The successful Black Belt usually
finds that his work has earned him a reputation that makes him a hot commodity when it’s time to end his Black Belt career.
There are, of course, innumerable complexities and details to be decided and
worked out. Usually these issues are worked out by a team of individuals with
members from Human Resources, the Six Sigma Core Team, and other areas
of the organization. The team will address such issues as:

positions? . Shouldthe pay grade be determined bythe pay grade ofthe candidate’s job

the Black Belt position to return to the organization? . How do we determine eligibility for the various rewards? For example, are
there key events such as acceptance as a Black Belt candidate, completion
of training, completion of ¢rst project, successful certi¢cation, etc.? . What about Black Belts who were certi¢ed by other organizations or third
parties? . Do we provide bene¢ts to Green Belts as well? If so, what and how? . Who will administer the bene¢ts package?
The plan will be of great interest to Black Belt candidates. If not done properly, the organization will find it difficult to recruit the best people.

Six Sigma Goals and Metrics
ATTRIBUTES OF GOOD METRICS
The choice of what to measure is crucial to the success of the organization.
Improperly chosen metrics lead to suboptimal behavior and can lead people
away from the organization’s goals instead of towards them. Joiner (1994) suggests three systemwide measures of performance: overall customer satisfaction,
total cycle time, and first-pass quality. An effective metric for quantifying firstpass quality is total cost of poor quality (later in this chapter). Once chosen,
the metrics must be communicated to the members of the organization. To
be useful, the employee must be able to influence the metric through his
performance, and it must be clear precisely how the employee’s performance
influences the metric.
Rose (1995) lists the following attributes of good metrics:
. They are customer centered and focused on indicators that provide value
to customers, such as product quality, service dependability, and timeliness of delivery, or are associated with internal work processes that
address system cost reduction, waste reduction, coordination and team
work, innovation, and customer satisfaction. . They measure performance across time, which shows trends rather than
snapshots. . They provide direct information at the level at which they are applied.
No further processing or analysis is required to determine meaning. . They are linked with the organization’s mission, strategies, and actions.
They contribute to organizational direction and control. . They are collaboratively developed by teams of people who provide,
collect, process, and use the data.

Rose also presents a performance measurement model consisting of eight
steps: . Step 1: performance categoryLThis category is the fundamental division of organizational performance that answers the question: What do
we do? Sources for determining performance categories include an organization’s strategic vision, core competencies, or mission statement. An
organization will probably identify several performance categories.
These categories de¢ne the organization at the level at which it is being
measured. . Step 2: performance goalLThe goal statement is an operational de¢nition of the desired state of the performance category. It provides the target
for the performance category and, therefore, should be expressed in explicit, action-oriented terms. An initial goal statement might be right on the
mark, so complex that it needs further division of the performance category, or so narrowly drawn that it needs some combination of performance categories. It might be necessary to go back and forth between the
performance goals in this step and the performance categories in step 1
before a satisfactory result is found for both. . Step 3: performance indicatorLThis is the most important step in the
model because this is where progress toward the performance goal is disclosed. Here irrelevant measures are swept aside if they do not respond
to an organizational goal. This is where the critical measuresLthose that
communicate what is important and set the course toward organizational
successLare established. Each goal will have one or more indicators, and
each indicator must include an operational de¢nition that prescribes the
indicator’s intent and makes its role in achieving the performance goal
clear. The scope of the indicator might be viewed di¡erently at various
levels in the organization. . Step 4: elements of measureLThese elements are the basic components
that determine how well the organization meets the performance
indicator. They are the measurement data sourcesLwhat is actually
measuredLand are controlled by the organization. Attempting to measure things that are beyond organizational control is a futile diversion of
resources and energy because the organization is not in a position to
respond to the information collected. This would be best handled in the
next step. . Step 5: parametersLThese are the external considerations that in£uence
the elements of measure in some way, such as context, constraint, and
boundary. They are not controlled by the organization but are powerful
factors in determining how the elements of measure will be used. If
measurement data analysis indicates that these external considerations
Attributes of Good Metrics 57
present serious roadblocks for organizational progress, a policy change
action could be generated. . Step 6: means of measurementLThis step makes sense out of the
preceding pieces. A general, how-to action statement is written that
describes how the elements of measure and their associated parameters
will be applied to determine the achievement level in the performance
indicator. This statement can be brief, but clarifying intent is more important than the length. . Step 7: notional metricsLIn this step, conceptual descriptions of possible metrics resulting from the previous steps are put in writing. This step
allows everyone to agree on the concept of how the information compiled
in the previous steps will be applied to measuring organizational performance. It provides a basis for validating the process and for subsequently
developing speci¢c metrics. . Step 8: speci¢c metricsLIn this ¢nal step, an operational de¢nition and
a functional description of the metrics to be applied are written. The
de¢nition and description describe the data, how they are collected,
how they are used, and, most importantly, what the data mean or how
they a¡ect organizational performance. A prototype display of real or
imaginary data and a descriptive scenario that shows what actions
might be taken as a result of the measurement are also made. This last
step is the real test of any metric. It must identify what things need to
be done and disclose conditions in su⁄cient detail to enable subsequent
improvement actions.
Rose presents an application of his model used by the U.S. Army Materiel
Command, which is shown in Figure 2.1.
SIX SIGMA VERSUS TRADITIONAL THREE SIGMA
PERFORMANCE
The traditional quality model of process capability differed from Six Sigma
in two fundamental respects:
1. It was applied only to manufacturing processes, while Six Sigma is
applied to all important business processes.
2. It stipulatedthat a ‘‘capable’’ process was onethat had a process standard
deviation of no more than one-sixth of the total allowable spread,
where Six Sigma requires the process standard deviation be no more
than one-twelfth of the total allowable spread.
These differences are far more profound than one might realize. By addressing all business processes Six Sigma not only treats manufacturing as part of a
58 SIX SIGMA GOALS AND METRICS
larger system, it removes the narrow, inward focus of the traditional approach.
Customers care about more than just how well a product is manufactured.
Price, service, financing terms, style, availability, frequency of updates and
enhancements, technical support, and a host of other items are also important.
Also, Six Sigma benefits others besides customers. When operations become
more cost-effective and the product design cycle shortens, owners or investors
benefit too. When employees become more productive their pay can be
increased. Six Sigma’s broad scope means that it provides benefits to all stakeholders in the organization.
The second point also has implications that are not obvious. Six Sigma is,
basically, a process quality goal, where sigma is a statistical measure of variability in a process. As such it falls into the category of a process capability
technique. The traditional quality paradigm defined a process as capable if
the process’s natural spread, plus and minus three sigma, was less than the
engineering tolerance. Under the assumption of normality, this three sigma
quality level translates to a process yield of 99.73%. A later refinement considered the process location as well as its spread and tightened the minimum
acceptance criterion so that the process mean was at least four sigma from

February 1995, p. 65. Reprinted by permission.
the nearest engineering requirement. Six Sigma requires that processes operate such that the nearest engineering requirement is at least Six Sigma from
the process mean.
Six Sigma also applies to attribute data, such as counts of things gone wrong.
This is accomplished by converting the Six Sigma requirement to equivalent
conformance levels, as illustrated in Figure 2.2.
One of Motorola’s most significant contributions was to change the discussion of quality from one where quality levels were measured in percent (partsper-hundred), to a discussion of parts-per-million or even parts-per-billion.
Motorola correctly pointed out that modern technology was so complex that
old ideas about ‘‘acceptable quality levels’’ could no longer be tolerated.
Modern business requires near perfect quality levels.
One puzzling aspect of the ‘‘official’’ Six Sigma literature is that it states that
a process operating at Six Sigma will produce 3.4 parts-per-million (PPM) nonconformances. However, if a special normal distribution table is consulted
(very few go out to Six Sigma) one finds that the expected non-conformances
are 0.002 PPM (2 parts-per-billion, or PPB). The difference occurs because
Motorola presumes that the process mean can drift 1.5 sigma in either direction.
The area of a normal distribution beyond 4.5 sigma from the mean is indeed 3.4
PPM. Since control charts will easily detect any process shift of this magnitude
60 SIX SIGMA GOALS AND METRICS
Figure 2.2. Sigma levels and equivalent conformance rates.
in a single sample, the 3.4 PPM represents a very conservative upper bound on
the non-conformance rate.
In contrast to Six Sigma quality, the old three sigma quality standard of
99.73% translates to 2,700 PPM failures, even if we assume zero drift. For processes with a series of steps, the overall yield is the product ofthe yields ofthe different steps. For example, if we had a simple two step process where step #1
had a yield of 80% and step #2 had a yield of 90%, then the overall yield would
be 0:8  0:9 ¼ 0:72 ¼ 72%. Note that the overall yield from processes involving a series of steps is always less than the yield of the step with the lowest
yield. If three sigma quality levels (99.97% yield) are obtained from every step
in a ten step process, the quality level at the end of the process will contain
26,674 defects per million! Considering that the complexity of modern processes is usually far greater than ten steps, it is easy to see that Six Sigma quality
isn’t optional, it’s required if the organization is to remain viable.
The requirement of extremely high quality is not limited to multiple-stage
manufacturing processes. Consider what three sigma quality would mean if
applied to other processes: . Virtually no modern computer would function. . 10,800,000 mishandled healthcare claims each year. . 18,900 lost U.S. savings bonds every month. . 54,000 checks lost each night by a single large bank. . 4,050 invoices sent out incorrectly each month by a modest-sized telecommunications company. . 540,000 erroneous call detail records each day from a regional telecommunications company. . 270,000,000 (270 million) erroneous credit card transactions each year in
the United States.
With numbers like these, it’s easy to see that the modern world demands
extremely high levels of error free performance. Six Sigma arose in response to
this realization.
THE BALANCED SCORECARD
Given the magnitude of the difference between Six Sigma and the traditional
three sigma performance levels, the decision to pursue Six Sigma performance
obviously requires a radical change in the way things are done. The organization
that makes this commitment will never be the same. Since the expenditure of
time and resources will be huge, it is crucial that Six Sigma projects and activities are linked to the organization’s top-level goals. It is even more important
that these be the right goals. An organization that uses Six Sigma to pursue the
wrong goals will just get to the wrong place more quickly. The organization’s
The Balanced Scorecard 61
goals must ultimately come from the constituencies it serves: customers, shareholders or owners, and employees. Focusing too much on the needs of any one
of these groups can be detrimental to all of them in the long run. For example,
companies that look at shareholder performance as their only significant goal
may lose employees and customers. To use the balanced scorecard senior management must translate these stakeholder-based goals into metrics. These goals
and metrics are then mapped to a strategy for achieving them. Dashboards are
developed to display the metrics for each constituency or stakeholder. Finally,
Six Sigma is used to either close gaps in critical metrics, or to help develop new
processes, products and services consistent with top management’s strategy.
Balanced scorecards helpthe organization maintain perspective by providing
a concise display of performance metrics in four areas that correspond roughly
tothemajor stakeholdersLcustomer,financial,internal processes, andlearning
and growth (Kaplan and Norton, 1992). The simultaneous measurement from
different perspectives prevents local suboptimization, the common phenomenon where performance in one part of the organization is improved at the
expense of performance in another part of the organization. This leads to the
well-known loop wherethis year wefocus on quality, driving up costs. Next year
we focus on costs, hurting cycle time. When we look at cycle time people take
short cuts, hurting quality. And so on. This also happens on a larger scale, where
we alternately focus on employees, customers, or shareholders at the expense of
the stakeholders who are not the current focus. Clearly, such ‘‘firefighting’’
doesn’tmake anyonehappy.Wetrulyneedthe ‘‘balance’’in balanced scorecards.
Well-designed dashboards include statistical guidance to aid in interpreting
the metrics. These guidelines most commonly take the form of limits, the calculation of which are discussed in detail elsewhere in this book. Limits are statistically calculated guidelines that operationally define when intervention is
needed. Generally, when metrics fall within the limits, the process should be
left alone. However, when a metric falls outside of the limits, it indicates that
something important has changed that requires attention. An exception to
these general rules occurs when a deliberate intervention is made to achieve a
goal. In this case the metric is supposed torespond to the intervention by moving
in a positive direction. The limits will tell leadership if the intervention produced the desired result. If so, the metric will go beyond the proper control
limit indicating improvement. Once the metric stabilizes at the new and
improved level, the limits should be recalculated so they can detect slippage.
Measuring causes and effects
Dashboard metrics are measurements of the results delivered by complex
processes and systems. These results are, in a sense, ‘‘effects’’ caused by things
62 SIX SIGMA GOALS AND METRICS
taking place within the processes. For example, ‘‘cost per unit’’ might be a
metric on a top-level dashboard. This is, in turn, composed of the cost of materials, overhead costs, labor, etc. Cost of materials is a ‘‘cause’’ of the cost per
unit. Cost of materials can be further decomposed into, say, cost of raw materials, cost of purchased sub-assemblies, etc. and so on. At some level we reach a
‘‘root cause,’’ or most basic reason behind an effect. Black Belts and Green
Belts learn numerous tools and techniques to help them identify these root
causes. However, the dashboard is the starting point for the quest.
In Six Sigma work, results are known as ‘‘Ys’’ and root causes are known as
‘‘Xs.’’ Six Sigma’s historical roots are technical and its originators generally
came from engineering and scientific backgrounds. In the mathematics taught
to engineers and scientists equations are used that often express a relationship
in the form:
Y ¼ f XðÞ ð2:1Þ
This equation simply means that the value identified by the letter Y is determined as a function of some other value X. The equation Y = 2X means that if
we know what X is, we can find Y if we multiply X by 2. If X is the temperature
of a solution, then Y might be the time it takes the solution to evaporate.
Equations can become more complicated. For example, Y = f(X1, X2) indicates
that the value Y depends on the value of two different X variables. You should
think of the X in Equation 2.1 as including any number of X variables. There
can be many levels of dashboards encountered between the top-level Y, called
the ‘‘Big Y,’’ and the root cause Xs. In Six Sigma work some special notation
has evolved to identify whether a root cause is being encountered, or an intermediate result. Intermediate results are sometimes called ‘‘Little Ys.’’
In these equations think of Y as the output of a process and the Xs as inputs.
The process itself is symbolized by the f(). The process can be thought of as a
transfer function that converts inputs into outputs in some way. An analogy is
a recipe. Here’s an example:
Corn Crisp Recipe
12 servings
3
4 cup yellow stone-ground cornmeal
1 cup boiling water
1
2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons melted butter
Preheat the oven to 4008F. Stir the cornmeal and boiling water together in a
large glass measuring cup. Add the salt and melted butter. Mix well and
The Balanced Scorecard 63
pour onto a cookie sheet. Using a spatula, spread the batter out as thin as you
possibly canLthe thinner the crisper. Bake the cornmeal for half an hour or
until crisp and golden brown. Break into 12 roughly equal pieces.
Here the Big Y is the customer’s overall satisfaction with the finished corn
crisp. Little Ys would include flavor ratings, ‘‘crunchiness’’ rating, smell, freshness, and other customer-derived metrics that drive the Big Y. Xs that drive the
little Ys might include thinness of the chips, the evenness of the salt, the size of
each chip, the color of the chip, and other measurements on the finished product. Xs could also be determined at each major step, e.g., actual measurement
of the ingredients, the oven temperature, the thoroughness of stirring, how
much the water cools before it is stirred with the cornmeal, actual bake time,
etc. Xs would also include the oven used, the cookware, utensils, etc.
Finally, the way different cooks follow the recipe is the transfer function or
actual process that converts the ingredients into corn crisps. Numerous sources
of variation (more Xs) can probably be identified by observing the cooks in
action. Clearly, even such a simple process can generate some very interesting
discussions. If you haven’t developed dashboards it might be worthwhile to do
so for the corn crisps as a practice exercise.
Figure 2.3 illustrates how dashboard metrics flow down until eventually
linking with Six Sigma projects.
Information systems
Balanced scorecards begin with the highest level metrics. At any given level,
dashboards will display a relatively small number of metrics. While this allows
the user of the dashboard to focus on key items, it also presents a problem
when the metric goes outside a control limit for reasons other than deliberate
management action. When this happens the question is: Why did this metric
change? Information systems (IS) can help answer this question by providing
‘‘drill down’’ capability. Drill down involves disaggregating dashboard metrics
into their component parts. For example, a cost-per-unit metric can be decomposed by division, plant, department, shift, worker, week, etc. These components of the higher-level metric are sometimes already on dashboards at lower
levels of the organization, in which case the answer is provided in advance.
However, if the lower-level dashboard metrics can’t explain the situation,
other exploratory drill downs may be required. On-line analytic processing
(OLAP) cubes often ease the demands on the IS caused by drill down requests.
This raises an important point: in Six Sigma organizations the IS must be
accessed by many more people. The attitude of many IS departments is ‘‘The
data systems belong to us. If you want some data, submit a formal request.’’ In
64 SIX SIGMA GOALS AND METRICS
a Six Sigma organization, this attitude is hopelessly outmoded. The demands on
the IS increase dramatically when Six Sigma is deployed. In addition to the creation of numerous dashboards, and the associated drill downs and problem
investigations, the Black Belts and Green Belts make frequent use of IS in their
projects. Six Sigma ‘‘show me the data’’ emphasis places more demands on the
IS. In planning for Six Sigma success, companies need to assign a high-level
champion to oversee the adaptation of the IS to the new realities of Six Sigma.
A goal is to make access as easy as possible while maintaining data security and
integrity.
Although it’s important to be timely, most Six Sigma data analyses don’t
require real-time data access. Data that are a day or a few days old will often suffice. The IS department may want to provide facilities for off-line data analysis
by Six Sigma team members and Belts. A few high-end workstations capable of
handling large data sets or intensive calculations are also very useful at times,
especially for data mining analyses such as clustering, neural networks, or classification and decision trees.
Customer perspective
Let’s take a closer look at each of the major perspectives on the balanced
scorecard, starting with the customer. The balanced scorecard requires that
The Balanced Scorecard 65

management translate their vague corporate mission (‘‘Acme will be #1 in
providing customer value’’) into specific measures of factors that matter to
customers. The customer scorecard answers the question: ‘‘How do our customers view us?’’
To answer this, you must ask yourself two related questions: What things do
customers consider when evaluating us? How do we know? While the only
true way to answer these questions is to communicate with real customers, it is
well establishedthat customers in general tendto consider four broad categories
of factors when evaluating an organization: . Quality. How well do you keep your promises by delivering error free
service or defect free product. Did I receive what I ordered? Was it
undamaged? Are your promised delivery times accurate? Do you honor
your warranty or pay your claims without a hassle? . Timeliness. How fast is your service? How long does it take to have my
order delivered? Do improvements appear in a timely manner? . Performance and service. How do your products and services help me? Are
they dependable? . Value. What is the cost of buying and owning your product or service? Is it
worth it?
The first step inthe translation is to determine preciselywhatcustomers consider when evaluating your organization. This can be done by communicating
with customers via one-on-one contacts, focus groups, questionnaires, chat
rooms, forums, etc. Management should see the actual, unvarnished words
used by customers to describe what they think about the company, its products,
and its services. Once management is thoroughly familiar with their target customer, they need to articulate their customer goals in words meaningful to
them. For example, management might say: . We will cut the time required to introduce a new product from 9 months
to 3 months. . We will be the best in the industry for on-time delivery. . We will intimately involve our customers in the design of our next major
product.
These goals must be operationalized by designating metrics to act as surrogates for the goals. Think of the goals themselves as latent or hidden constructs.
The objective is to identify observable things directly related to the goals that
can be measured. These are indicators that help guide you towards your goals.
Table 2.1 shows examples of how the goals mentioned above might be operationalized.
These goals are key requirements that employees will be asked to achieve. It is
crucial that they not be set arbitrarily. More will be said about this later in this

Internal process perspective
In the Internal Process section of the balanced scorecard we develop metrics
that help answer the question: What internal processes must we excel at?
Internal process excellence is linked to customer perceived value, but the linkage is indirect and imperfect. It is often possible to hide internal problems
from customers by throwing resources at problems; for example, increased
inspection and testing. Also, customer perceived value is affected by factors
other than internal processes such as price, competitive offerings, etc.
Similarly, internal operations consume resources so they impact the shareholders. Here again, the linkage is indirect and imperfect. For example, sometimes it is in the organization’s strategic interest to drive up costs in order to
meet critical short-term customer demands or to head off competitive moves
in the market. Thus, simply watching the shareholder or customer dashboards
won’t always give leadership a good idea of how well internal processes are
performing. A separate dashboard is needed for this purpose.
This section of the scorecard gives operational managers the internal direction they need to focus on customer needs. Internal metrics should be chosen
to support the leadership’s customer strategy, plus knowledge of what customers need from internal operations. Process maps should be created that show
the linkage between suppliers, inputs, process activities, outputs and customers
(SIPOC). SIPOC is a flowcharting technique that helps identify those processes

Companies need to identify and measure their core competencies. These are
areas where the company must excel. It is the source of their competitive advantage. Goals in these areas must be ambitious and challenging. This where you
‘‘Wow’’ your customer. Other key areas will pursue goals designed to satisfy
customers, perhaps by maintaining competitive performance levels. Table 2.2
shows how core competencies might drive customer value propositions. The
metrics may be similar for the different companies, but the goals will differ significantly. For example, Company A would place greater emphasis on the time
required to develop and introduce new services. Companies B and C would
not ignore this aspect of their internal operations, but their goals would be less
ambitious in this area than Company A’s. Company A is the industry benchmark for innovation.
Of course, it is possible that your competitor will try to leapfrog you in your
core competency, becoming the new benchmark and stealing your customers.
Or you may find that your customer base is dwindling and the market for your
particular competency is decreasing. Leadership must stay on the alert for such
developments and be prepared to react quickly. Most companies will fight to
maintain their position of industry leadership as long as there is an adequate
market. Six Sigma can help in this battle because Six Sigma projects are usually

Innovation and learning perspective
In the Innovation and Learning Perspective section ofthe balanced scorecard
we develop metrics that help answer the question: Can we continue to improve
and create value? Success is a moving target. What worked yesterday may fail
miserably tomorrow. Previous sections of the balanced scorecard have identified the metrics the leadership considers to be most important for success in
the near future. But the organization must be prepared to meet the new and
changing demands that the more distant future will surely bring. Building shareholder value is especially dependent on the company’s ability to innovate,
improve, and learn. The intrinsic value of a business is the discounted value of
the cash that can be taken out of the business during its remaining life (Buffett,
1996). Intrinsic value is directly related to a company’s ability to create new products and processes, to improve operating efficiency, to discover and develop
new markets, and to increase revenues and margins. Companies able to do this
well will throw off more cash over the long term than companies that do it
poorly. The cash generated can be withdrawn by the owners, or reinvested in
the business.
Innovation and learning were the areas addressed by the continuous
improvement (CI) initiatives of the past. Devotees of CI will be happy to
learn that it’s alive and well in the Six Sigma world. However, CI projects
were often local in scope, while most Black Belt Six Sigma projects are crossfunctional. Many so-called Green Belt projects (Six Sigma projects that don’t
have a dedicated Black Belt on the project team) are reminiscent of the CI
projects in the past. Also, CI tended to focus narrowly on work processes,
while Green Belt projects cover a broader range of business processes, products, and services. A well-designed Six Sigma program will have a mix of
Green Belt and Black Belt projects addressing a range of enterprise and local
process improvement issues.
Dashboards designed to measure performance in the area of Innovation and
Learning often address three major areas: employee competencies, technology,
and corporate culture. These are operationalized in a wide variety of ways.
One metric is the average rate of improvement in the sigma level of an organizational unit. Six Sigma attempts to reduce mistakes, errors, and defects by a factor of 10 every two years, which translates to about 17% per month. This
breakthrough rate of improvement is usually not attained instantly and a metric
of the actual rate is a good candidate for including on the Innovation and
Learning dashboard. The rate of improvement is a measure of the overall maturThe Balanced Scorecard 69
ity of the Six Sigma initiative. Other Innovation and Learning metric candidates
might include such things as: . Results of employee feedback . R&D cycle time . Closure of gaps identi¢ed in the training needs audit
Financial perspective
Obsession with financial metrics has been the undoing of many improvement initiatives. When senior leaders look only at results they miss the fact
that these results come from a complex chain of interacting processes that effectively and efficiently produce value for customers. Only by providing value
that customers are willing to pay for can an enterprise generate sales, and only
by creating these values at a cost less than their price can it produce profits for
owners. For many companies the consequence of looking only at short-term
financial results has been a long-term decline in business performance. Many
companies have gone out of business altogether.
The result of this unfortunate history is that many critics have advocated the
complete abandonment of the practice of using financial metrics to guide leadership action. The argument goes something like this: since financial results
are determined by a combination of customer satisfaction and the way the organization runs its internal operations, if we focus on these factors the financial
performance will follow in due course. This is throwing the baby out with the
bathwater. The flaw in the logic is that it assumes that leaders and managers
know precisely how customer satisfaction and internal operational excellence
lead to financial results. This arrogance is unjustified. Too often we learn in retrospect that we are focusing on the wrong things and the financial results fail
to materialize. For example, we may busily set about improving the throughput
of a process that already has plenty of excess capacity. All we get from this effort
is more excess capacity. Many Six Sigma improvements don’t result in bottomline impact because management fails to take the necessary steps such as
reducing excess inventory, downsizing extra personnel, selling off unneeded
equipment, etc. As Toyota’s Taiichi Ohno says:
If , as a result of labor saving, 0.9 of a worker is saved, it means nothing. At
least one person must be saved before a cost reduction results. Therefore,
we must attain worker saving.
Taiichi Ohno
Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production
The truth is, it’s very difficult to lay people off and a poor reward for people
who may have participated in creating the improvement. Most managers agree
70 SIX SIGMA GOALS AND METRICS
that this is the worst part of their job. However, simply ignoring the issue isn’t
the best way to deal with it. Plans must be made before starting a project for
adjusting to the consequences of success. If there will be no bottom-line impact
because there are to be no plans to convert the savings into actual reductions
in resource requirements, the project shouldn’t be undertaken in the first
place. Onthe other hand, plans can often be made atthe enterprise levelfor dealing with the positive results of Six Sigma by such means as hiring moratoriums,
early retirement packages, etc. Better still are plans to increase sales or to grow
the business to absorb the new capacity. This can often be accomplished by
modifying the customer value proposition through more reliable products,
lower prices, faster delivery time, lower cycle times, etc. These enhancements
are made possible as a result of the Six Sigma improvements.
There are other ways to go wrong if financial results are not explicitly monitored. We may blindly pour resources into improving customer satisfaction as
measured by a faulty or incomplete survey. Or the competition may discover a
new technology that makes ours obsolete. The list of things that can break the
link between internal strategies and financial performance is endless. Financial
performance metrics provide us with the feedback we need to assure that we
haven’t completely missed the boat with our assumptions.
Actual metrics for monitoring financial performance are numerous. The toplevel dashboard will often include metrics in the areas of improved efficiency
(e.g., cost per unit, asset utilization) or improved effectiveness (e.g., revenue
growth, market share increase, profit per customer).
STRATEGY DEPLOYMENT PLAN
Unlike traditional measurement systems, which tend to have a control bias,
balanced scorecards are based on strategy. The idea is to realize the leadership
vision using a set of linked strategies. Metrics operationalize these strategies
and create a bond between the activities of the organization and the vision of
the leadership.
Figure 2.4 illustrates these principles for a hypothetical organization. Things
that will actually be measured are shown in rectangles. The dashboard metrics
appear on the left side of the figure. The strategy deployment plan makes it clear
thatthe metrics are not ends inthemselves,they are merely measurements of bigger items of interest. These unobserved, or latent constructs are shown in ellipses
and are inferred from the metrics. This perspective helps leadership understand
the limitations of metrics, as well as their value. If, for example, all of the metrics
leading to shareholder perceived value are strongly positive, but surveys of the
shareholders (Voice of Shareholder) indicate shareholder dissatisfaction, then
the dashboard metrics are obviously inadequate and need to be revised.
Strategy Deployment Plan 71
72 SIX SIGMA GOALS AND METRICS
Figure 2.4. Strategy deployment plan for a hypothetical organization.
The organization is pursuing a particular strategy and emphasizing certain
dashboard metrics, which are shown in boldface type. Goals for these metrics
will be set very high in an attempt to differentiate this organization from its
competition. Goals for other metrics (key requirements) will be set to achieve
competitiveness. Usually this means to maintain historical levels for these
metrics.
The organization’s leaders believe their core competencies are in the areas of
technology and customer service. They want their customers to think of them as
The company to go to for the very best products completely customized to
meet extremely demanding needs.
However, note that the organization’s differentiators are:
1. Cost per unit
2. Revenues from new sources
3. [Customer] service relationship
4. Product introductions, [new product] revenues
5. Research deployment time
It appears that item 1 is inconsistent with the leadership vision. Most people would be confused if asked to achieve benchmark status for items 2^5 as
well as for item 1. The plan indicates that the productivity strategy for this
organization should be reevaluated. Unless the company is losing its market
due to uncompetitive prices, or losing its investors due to low profits, item 1
should probably be a key requirement maintained at historical levels. If costs
are extremely out of line, cost per unit might be the focus of a greater than
normal amount of attention to bring it down to reasonable levels. However,
it should not be shown as a differentiator on the strategic dashboard. The
company has no desire to become a cost leader in the eyes of customers or
shareholders.
Six Sigma plays a vital role in achieving the leadership vision by providing the
resources needed to facilitate change where it is needed. Six Sigma projects are
linked to dashboard metrics through the project selection process discussed
elsewhere in this book. The process involves calculating the expected impact of
the project on a dashboard metric. The metrics used for Six Sigma projects are
typically on a lower-level dashboard, but since the lower-level dashboard
metrics flow down from the top level, the linkage is explicit. The process begins
by identifying the gap between the current state and the goal for each top-level
dashboard metric; Master Black Belts commonly assist with this activity. Six
Sigma projects impacting differentiator dashboard metrics which show large
gaps are prime candidates. This determination is usually done by Master Black
Belts. This information is also very useful in selecting Black Belt candidates.
Candidates with backgrounds in areas where high-impact projects will be
Strategy Deployment Plan 73
pursued may be given preference over equally qualified candidates from elsewhere in the organization.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS
Six Sigma technical leaders work to extract actionable knowledge from an
organization’s information warehouse. To assure access to the needed information, Six Sigma activities should be closely integrated with the information
systems (IS) of the organization. Obviously, the skills and training of Six
Sigma technical leaders must be supplemented by an investment in software
and hardware. It makes little sense to hamstring these experts by saving a few
dollars on computers or software. Six Sigma often requires the analysis of huge
amounts of data using highly sophisticated algorithms. The amount of time
required to perform the analysis can be considerable, even with today’s
advanced processing equipment. Without state-of-the-art tools, the situation is
often hopeless.
Integrating Six Sigma with other information
systems technologies
There are three information systems topics that are closely related to Six
Sigma activities: . Data warehousing . On-line Analytic Processing (OLAP) . Data mining
The first topic relates to what data is retained by the organization, and therefore available for use in Six Sigma activities. It also impacts on how the data is
stored, which impacts on ease of access for Six Sigma analyses. OLAP enables
the analysis of large databases by persons who may not have the technical background of a Six Sigma technical leader. Data mining involves retrospective analysis of data using advanced tools and techniques. Each of these subjects will
be discussed in turn.
DATA WAREHOUSING
Data warehousing has progressed rapidly. Virtually non-existent in 1990,
now every large corporation has at least one data warehouse and some have several. Hundreds of vendors offer data warehousing solutions, from software to
hardware to complete systems. Few standards exist and there are as many data
warehousing implementations as there are data warehouses. However, the
multitiered approach to data warehousing is a model that appears to be gaining
74 SIX SIGMA GOALS AND METRICS
favor and recent advances in technology and decreases in prices have made this
option more appealing to corporate users.
Multitiereddatawarehousing architecturefocusesonhowthe data areusedin
the organization. While access and storage considerations may require summarization of data into multiple departmental warehouses, it is better for Six
Sigma analysis if the warehouse keeps all of the detail in the data for historical
analysis. The major components ofthis architecture are(Berry and Linoff, 1997): . Source systems are where the data come from. . Data transport and cleansing move data between di¡erent data stores. . The central repository is the main store for the data warehouse. . The metadata describes what is available and where. . Data marts provide fast, specialized access for end users and applications. . Operational feedback integrates decision support back into the operational systems. . End usersare the reason for developing the warehouse in the ¢rst place.
Figure 2.5 illustrates the multitiered approach.
Every data warehouse includes at least one of these building blocks. The data
originates in the source systems and flows to the end users through the various
components. The components can be characterized as hardware, software, and
networks. The purpose is to deliver information, which is in turn used to create
new knowledge, which is then acted on to improve business performance. In
other words, the data warehouse is ultimately a component in a decisionsupport system.
OLAP
On-line analytic processing, or OLAP, is a collection of tools designed to
provide ordinary users with a means of extracting useful information from
large databases. These databases may or may not reside in a data warehouse.
If they do, then the user obtains the benefit of knowing the data has already
been cleansed, and access is likely to be more efficient. OLAP consists of
